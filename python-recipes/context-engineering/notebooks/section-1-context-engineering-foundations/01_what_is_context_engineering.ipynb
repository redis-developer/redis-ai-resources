    "## 🔬 The Context Rot Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research from Chroma (July 2025) reveals a critical challenge in working with LLMs: **context rot** - the phenomenon where LLM performance degrades non-uniformly as input context length increases, even on simple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Research Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Non-Uniform Performance Degradation**\n",
    "- Models don't process the 10,000th token as reliably as the 100th token\n",
    "- Performance drops aren't linear - they accelerate as context grows\n",
    "- Even simple tasks like word repetition fail with long context\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Needle-Question Similarity Matters**\n",
    "- Lower similarity between questions and retrieved information causes faster performance degradation\n",
    "- High semantic relevance is critical for maintaining accuracy\n",
    "- Generic or loosely related context actively harms performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Distractors Have Amplified Impact**\n",
    "- Similar-but-wrong information (distractors) degrade performance more as context grows\n",
    "- The negative impact of irrelevant information is non-linear\n",
    "- Filtering out low-relevance content is as important as finding relevant content\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Structure Affects Attention**\n",
    "- How you organize context affects model performance\n",
    "- Counterintuitively, shuffled text sometimes performs better than coherent text\n",
    "- Context window position matters - information placement impacts retrieval accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "The Context Rot research validates the core principles of this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Quality Over Quantity**\n",
    "More context isn't always better. Adding marginally relevant information can hurt performance more than it helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Semantic Similarity is Critical**\n",
    "High relevance between queries and retrieved context is essential. RAG systems must prioritize precision over recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Structure Matters**\n",
    "How you organize and present context affects LLM attention mechanisms. Context engineering isn't just about *what* information to include, but *how* to structure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Distractor Removal**\n",
    "Filtering out low-relevance information improves performance. Memory systems must be selective about what they store and retrieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Context Window Management**\n",
    "Understanding token limits isn't enough - you must understand how performance degrades within those limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This course teaches you techniques to engineer context effectively and avoid these pitfalls.**\n",

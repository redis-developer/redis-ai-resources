# Section 2: RAG Foundations

## Overview

This section teaches you to build a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using the Redis University Course Advisor as your foundation. You'll create an agent that can search through course catalogs, understand student profiles, and generate personalized recommendations.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this section, you will:
- Build a complete RAG agent using the reference-agent architecture
- Understand how retrieval-augmented generation works in practice
- Implement vector similarity search for course recommendations
- Create a foundation agent you'll enhance in later sections

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Section 1: Fundamentals
- Basic understanding of Python and object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with the concepts of context engineering

## Notebooks

**Main Learning Project**: Build Your Course Advisor Agent

This comprehensive notebook walks you through:

#### Step 1: Install and Explore the Reference Agent
- Install the reference-agent as an editable package
- Explore the professional data models (Course, StudentProfile, etc.)
- Understand the existing architecture

#### Step 2: Load the Course Catalog
- Initialize the CourseManager
- Load and explore the comprehensive course catalog
- Understand the data structure and relationships

#### Step 3: Create Student Profiles
- Build diverse student profiles with different backgrounds
- Test with various majors, experience levels, and interests
- Understand how student context affects recommendations

#### Step 4: Build Your First RAG System
- Implement the SimpleRAGAgent class
- Create the three core RAG components:
  - **Retrieval**: Search for relevant courses
  - **Augmentation**: Combine student context with course data
  - **Generation**: Create personalized responses

#### Step 5: Test Your RAG Agent
- Test with different student profiles and queries
- See how the agent personalizes responses
- Understand the impact of student context on recommendations

#### Step 6: Test Conversation Memory
- Implement basic conversation history tracking
- Test follow-up questions and context references
- See how memory enables natural conversations

#### Step 7: Analyze Your RAG System
- Break down the RAG process step by step
- Understand how each component contributes
- Measure system performance and metrics

#### Step 8: Foundation for Future Enhancements
- Review what you've built
- Understand how each component will be enhanced
- Preview upcoming sections and improvements

## Key Concepts Covered

### RAG Architecture
- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from knowledge bases
- **Augmentation**: Enhancing prompts with retrieved context
- **Generation**: Using LLMs to create personalized responses

### Context Management
- Student profile context (background, preferences, history)
- Course information context (descriptions, prerequisites, objectives)
- Conversation context (previous interactions, references)
- Context assembly and prioritization

### Professional Patterns
- Type-safe data models with Pydantic
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Error handling and graceful fallbacks
- Demo modes for development and testing

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components Built

1. **SimpleRAGAgent**: Main agent class implementing the RAG pipeline
2. **Context Assembly**: Intelligent combination of multiple context types
3. **Conversation Memory**: Basic history tracking for natural interactions
4. **Course Search**: Vector-based similarity search using CourseManager
5. **Response Generation**: LLM integration with fallback demo responses

### Architecture Patterns

```
Student Query → Course Search → Context Assembly → LLM Generation → Response
     ↓              ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓
"ML courses"   → Top 3 courses → Complete       → GPT-4        → "I recommend
                                 context                         RU301..."
```

### Data Flow

1. **Input**: Student profile + natural language query
2. **Retrieval**: Search course catalog for relevant matches
3. **Augmentation**: Combine student context + course data + conversation history
4. **Generation**: LLM creates personalized recommendation
5. **Memory**: Store interaction for future reference

## What You'll Build

By the end of this section, you'll have:

### A Complete RAG Agent That Can:
- Search through hundreds of courses intelligently
- Understand student backgrounds and preferences
- Generate personalized course recommendations
- Maintain conversation context across interactions
- Handle follow-up questions and references

### Professional Architecture Ready For:
- **Section 3**: Enhanced memory with Redis persistence
- **Section 4**: Multiple specialized tools and intelligent routing
- **Section 5**: Context optimization and production scaling

### Real-World Skills:
- RAG system design and implementation
- Context engineering best practices
- Professional Python development patterns
- LLM integration and prompt engineering

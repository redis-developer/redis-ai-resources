    "## The 4 Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Every context-aware AI system has these 4 components. Let's see them in the agent you built:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. System Context (Static)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Instructions and knowledge that rarely change\n",
    "\n",
    "**From your example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "system_prompt = \"\"\"\n",
    "You are a class scheduling assistant.  # ← Role definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Available Courses:                      # ← Domain knowledge\n",
    "- CS401: Machine Learning...\n",
    "\n",
    "Help students with course planning.     # ← Behavior instructions\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Includes:**\n",
    "- Agent role and personality\n",
    "- Business rules and policies\n",
    "- Domain knowledge\n",
    "- Available tools and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Memory (Dynamic)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Information that persists across interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**From your example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "student_context = \"\"\"\n",
    "Student Profile:\n",
    "- Completed Courses: CS101, CS201  # ← Persistent user data\n",
    "- Current GPA: 3.7\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two types:**\n",
    "- **Working Memory:** Current conversation context\n",
    "- **Long-term Memory:** User preferences, history, facts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Context Retrieval (Dynamic)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Relevant information retrieved based on the current query\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# User asks: \"What ML courses are available?\"\n",
    "# System retrieves:\n",
    "relevant_courses = [\n",
    "    \"CS401: Machine Learning Fundamentals\",\n",
    "    \"CS501: Advanced Machine Learning\",\n",
    "    \"CS502: Deep Learning\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sources:**\n",
    "- Database queries\n",
    "- Vector search (semantic similarity)\n",
    "- API calls to external services\n",
    "- File system searches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Tools (Dynamic)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Functions the AI can call to take actions or get information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def search_courses(query):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Search for courses matching the query\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Implementation here\n",
    "    \n",
    "def check_prerequisites(course_id, student_id):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Check if student meets prerequisites\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Implementation here\n",
    "    \n",
    "def enroll_student(course_id, student_id):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Enroll student in course\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Implementation here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## The Context Window Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fundamental limitation:** Every AI model has a maximum amount of text it can process at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Token Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Window = Maximum tokens per request**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Context Window | Approximate Words |\n",
    "|-------|----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| GPT-4o | 128,000 tokens | ~96,000 words |\n",
    "| GPT-4o-mini | 128,000 tokens | ~96,000 words |\n",
    "| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 200,000 tokens | ~150,000 words |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** 1 token ≈ 0.75 words in English\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Competes for Space?\n",
    "\n",
    "Every request must fit:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n",
    "│     CONTEXT WINDOW (128K tokens)        │\n",
    "├─────────────────────────────────────────┤\n",
    "│ System Instructions       │ 2,000       │\n",

    "└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Everything scales:**\n",
    "- More tools → More tokens used\n",
    "- Longer conversations → More tokens used  \n",
    "- More retrieved data → More tokens used\n",
    "- Larger knowledge base → More tokens used\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context engineering is optimization within constraints.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Trade-off Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every token spent on one thing is a token NOT available for another.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good context engineering asks:**\n",
    "1. Is this information relevant to the current query?\n",
    "2. Does including this improve response quality?\n",
    "3. Is the improvement worth the token cost?\n",
    "\n",
    "**All three must be \"yes\" or don't include it.**"

    "## Static vs. Dynamic Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Context comes in two fundamentally different forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Context (Rarely Changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Context that's fixed in your code, same for all users\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Written directly in application code\n",
    "- Same for all users and sessions\n",
    "- Changes require code deployment\n",
    "- Always present, fixed token cost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Static - hardcoded in your application\n",
    "SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n",
    "You are a class scheduling agent.\n",
    "Always be helpful and encouraging.\n",
    "Never recommend more than 5 courses at once.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "BUSINESS_RULES = \"\"\"\n",
    "- Students need 120 credits to graduate\n",
    "- Maximum 18 credits per semester\n",
    "- Prerequisites must be completed first\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use static:**\n",
    "- ✅ Applies to ALL users equally\n",
    "- ✅ Defines agent's role/personality\n",
    "- ✅ Rarely changes (less than monthly)\n",
    "- ✅ Must always be present\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Context (Constantly Changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Context retrieved at runtime, specific to user/session/query\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Stored in databases (Redis, vector stores)\n",
    "- Different for each user/session/query\n",
    "- Retrieved based on relevance\n",
    "- Variable token usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Dynamic - retrieved at runtime\n",
    "conversation_history = get_conversation(session_id)\n",
    "user_profile = get_student_profile(user_id)\n",
    "relevant_courses = search_courses(query, limit=5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use dynamic:**\n",
    "- ✅ Specific to a user or session\n",
    "- ✅ Needs to be personalized\n",
    "- ✅ Changes frequently\n",
    "- ✅ Comes from external sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Decision Framework\n",
    "\n",

    "## 5 Essential Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Start Simple, Add Complexity Gradually\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Wrong approach:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Trying to build everything at once\n",
    "system = ComplexAgent(\n",
    "    tools=[50_different_tools],\n",
    "    memory=AdvancedMemorySystem(),\n",
    "    retrieval=HybridRAGSystem(),\n",
    "    # ... 20 more components\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Right approach:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Step 1: Basic agent\n",
    "agent = BasicAgent(system_prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Add one tool\n",
    "agent.add_tool(search_courses)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Add memory\n",
    "agent.add_memory(conversation_memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Add retrieval\n",
    "agent.add_retrieval(course_database)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Measure Token Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Always know your token consumption:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count_tokens(text):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Count tokens in text (approximate)\"\"\"\n",
    "    return len(text.split()) * 1.3  # Rough estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Before sending request\n",
    "total_tokens = (\n",
    "    count_tokens(system_prompt) +\n",
    "    count_tokens(conversation_history) +\n",
    "    count_tokens(retrieved_context) +\n",
    "    count_tokens(user_query)\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Total tokens: {total_tokens}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Percentage of limit: {total_tokens/128000*100:.1f}%\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Optimize for Relevance, Not Completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Include everything:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad: Including all 500 courses\n",
    "context = get_all_courses()  # 50,000 tokens!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Include what's relevant:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Including top 5 relevant courses\n",
    "context = search_courses(query, limit=5)  # 1,000 tokens\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use Clear, Structured Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Unclear structure:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"You help with classes and here are courses CS101 intro programming CS201 data structures and student Alice completed CS101 help her\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Clear structure:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"\"\"\n",
    "ROLE: Class scheduling assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "AVAILABLE COURSES:\n",
    "- CS101: Intro to Programming\n",
    "- CS201: Data Structures (Prerequisite: CS101)\n",
    "\n",
    "STUDENT PROFILE:\n",
    "- Name: Alice\n",
    "- Completed: CS101\n",
    "\n",
    "TASK: Help the student plan their next courses.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Test and Iterate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context engineering is empirical - test everything:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Test different approaches\n",
    "test_queries = [\n",
    "    \"Can I take CS401?\",\n",
    "    \"What ML courses are available?\",\n",

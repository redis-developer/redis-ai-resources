    "## Building on Your Context-Engineered RAG Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 2, you built a sophisticated RAG agent with excellent context engineering. Now we'll enhance it with **advanced memory architecture** that provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **üß† Persistent Memory** - Remember conversations across sessions\n",
    "- **üìö Long-term Learning** - Build knowledge about each student over time\n",
    "- **üîÑ Memory Consolidation** - Summarize and organize conversation history\n",
    "- **‚ö° Efficient Retrieval** - Quick access to relevant past interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform your `SimpleRAGAgent` into a `MemoryEnhancedAgent` that:\n",
    "- Remembers student preferences and learning patterns\n",
    "- Maintains conversation continuity across sessions\n",
    "- Consolidates memory to prevent context bloat\n",
    "- Uses Redis for scalable memory persistence\n",

    "1. **Understand** the grounding problem and how memory solves context engineering challenges\n",

    "\n",
    "Your current RAG agent has basic conversation history, but faces limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Limitations:**\n",
    "- ‚ùå **Session-bound** - Forgets everything when restarted\n",
    "- ‚ùå **Linear growth** - Context gets longer with each exchange\n",
    "- ‚ùå **No consolidation** - Important insights get buried in history\n",
    "- ‚ùå **No learning** - Doesn't build knowledge about student preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory-Enhanced Benefits:**\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Persistent memory** - Remembers across sessions and restarts\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Intelligent consolidation** - Summarizes and organizes key insights\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Student modeling** - Builds comprehensive understanding of each student\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Efficient retrieval** - Finds relevant past context quickly\n",

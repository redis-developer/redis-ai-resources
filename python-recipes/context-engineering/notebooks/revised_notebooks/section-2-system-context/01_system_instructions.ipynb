    "# System Instructions: The Foundation of Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives (25 minutes)\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. **Build** effective system instructions step by step\n",
    "2. **Test** different instruction approaches and see their impact\n",
    "3. **Apply** behavioral guidelines to control agent responses\n",
    "4. **Integrate** Redis University context into system prompts\n",
    "5. **Optimize** instructions for specific use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- OpenAI API key configured\n",
    "- Basic understanding of LLM prompting\n",
    "- Redis Stack running (for advanced examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**System instructions** are the foundation of any AI agent. They define:\n",
    "- **Who** the agent is (role and identity)\n",
    "- **What** the agent can do (capabilities and tools)\n",
    "- **How** the agent should behave (personality and guidelines)\n",
    "- **When** to use different approaches (context-aware responses)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build system instructions for our Redis University Class Agent step by step, testing each version to see the impact.\n",

    "### System Context vs. Retrieved Context\n",
    "\n",
    "| System Context | Retrieved Context |\n",
    "|----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Static** - Same for every turn | **Dynamic** - Changes per query |\n",
    "| **Role & behavior** | **Specific facts** |\n",
    "| **Always included** | **Conditionally included** |\n",
    "| **Examples:** Agent role, capabilities, guidelines | **Examples:** Course details, user preferences, memories |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why System Instructions Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Good system instructions:\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Keep the agent focused on its purpose\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Prevent unwanted behaviors\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Ensure consistent personality\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Guide tool usage\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Set user expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor system instructions:\n",
    "- ‚ùå Lead to off-topic responses\n",
    "- ‚ùå Cause inconsistent behavior\n",
    "- ‚ùå Result in tool misuse\n",
    "- ‚ùå Create confused or unhelpful agents\n",

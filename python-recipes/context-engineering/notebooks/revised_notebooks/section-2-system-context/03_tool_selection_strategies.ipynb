    "\n",
    "As you add more tools, the LLM faces challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** Imagine you're building a class agent with tools for searching, filtering, listing, finding, and browsing courses. A student asks \"What computer science courses are available?\" Which tool should the LLM use? Without clear guidance, it might pick the wrong one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With 3 tools:**\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to choose\n",
    "- ✅ Clear distinctions\n",
    "\n",
    "**With 10+ tools:**\n",
    "- ⚠️ Similar-sounding tools\n",
    "- ⚠️ Overlapping functionality\n",
    "- ⚠️ Ambiguous queries\n",
    "- ⚠️ Wrong tool selection"

    "### The Problem: Scale Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In our course agent, we might need tools for:\n",
    "- Searching courses (by topic, department, difficulty, format)\n",
    "- Getting course details (by code, by name)\n",
    "- Checking prerequisites, enrollment, schedules\n",
    "- Managing student records\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick math:** With 3-5 variations per category, you could easily have 15-20 tools. That's when tool selection becomes critical."

    "\n",
    "The LLM follows a decision process:\n",

    "4. **Context** - User's query and conversation (\"Does this match the user's intent?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like this:** The LLM is reading a menu at a restaurant. Tool names are dish names, descriptions are the ingredients/explanation, and parameters are customization options. A vague menu leads to wrong orders!\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool selection problems scale quickly** - 3 tools are easy, 10+ tools create confusion\n",
    "2. **Names matter** - Specific, action-oriented names beat generic ones\n",
    "3. **Descriptions are critical** - Examples and use cases guide LLM decisions\n",
    "4. **Consolidation helps** - Fewer, well-designed tools beat many similar ones\n",
    "5. **Testing is essential** - Always verify tool selection with real queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Do:**\n",
    "- Use specific, descriptive tool names\n",
    "- Include \"Use this when...\" examples in descriptions\n",
    "- Specify what NOT to use the tool for\n",
    "- Test with ambiguous queries\n",

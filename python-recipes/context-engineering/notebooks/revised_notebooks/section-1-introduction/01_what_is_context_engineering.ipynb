    "# What is Context Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives (25 minutes)\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. **Define** context engineering and explain its importance in AI systems\n",
    "2. **Identify** the four core components of context engineering\n",
    "3. **Compare** AI agents with and without context engineering using concrete examples\n",
    "4. **Describe** the role of memory in intelligent agents\n",
    "5. **Recognize** real-world applications and benefits of context engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Basic understanding of AI and language models\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python programming\n",
    "- No prior experience with Redis or vector databases required\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Engineering** is the discipline of designing, implementing, and optimizing context management systems for AI agents and applications. It's the practice of ensuring that AI systems have the right information, at the right time, in the right format to make intelligent decisions and provide relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of context engineering as the \"memory and awareness system\" for AI agents - it's what allows them to:\n",
    "- Remember past conversations and experiences\n",
    "- Understand their role and capabilities\n",
    "- Access relevant information from large knowledge bases\n",
    "- Maintain coherent, personalized interactions over time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Context Engineering Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Without proper context engineering, AI agents are like people with severe amnesia - they can't remember what happened five minutes ago, don't know who they're talking to, and can't learn from experience. This leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Poor User Experience**\n",
    "- Repetitive conversations\n",
    "- Lack of personalization\n",
    "- Inconsistent responses\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Inefficient Operations**\n",
    "- Redundant processing\n",
    "- Inability to build on previous work\n",
    "- Lost context between sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Limited Capabilities**\n",
    "- Can't handle complex, multi-step tasks\n",
    "- No learning or adaptation\n",
    "- Poor integration with existing systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components of Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Context engineering involves several key components working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **System Context**\n",
    "What the AI should know about itself and its environment:\n",
    "- Role and responsibilities\n",
    "- Available tools and capabilities\n",
    "- Operating constraints and guidelines\n",
    "- Domain-specific knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Memory Management**\n",
    "How information is stored, retrieved, and maintained:\n",
    "- **Working memory**: Persistent storage focused on the current task, including conversation context and task-related data\n",
    "- **Long-term memory**: Knowledge learned across sessions, such as user preferences and important facts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Context Retrieval**\n",
    "How relevant information is found and surfaced:\n",
    "- Semantic search and similarity matching\n",
    "- Relevance ranking and filtering\n",
    "- Context window management\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Context Integration**\n",
    "How different types of context are combined:\n",
    "- Merging multiple information sources\n",
    "- Resolving conflicts and inconsistencies\n",
    "- Prioritizing information by importance"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "From this introduction to context engineering, we can see several important principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Context is Multi-Dimensional**\n",
    "- **System context**: What the AI knows about itself\n",
    "- **User context**: What the AI knows about the user\n",
    "- **Domain context**: What the AI knows about the subject matter\n",
    "- **Conversation context**: What has been discussed recently\n",
    "- **Historical context**: What has been learned over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these sources are static, updated only when the agent's code changes,\n",
    "while others may be retrieved dynamically from external sources, such as\n",
    "via APIs or vector search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Memory is Essential**\n",
    "- **Working memory**: Maintains conversation flow and task-related context\n",
    "- **Long-term memory**: Enables learning and personalization across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Context Must Be Actionable**\n",
    "- Information is only valuable if it can improve responses\n",
    "- Context should be prioritized by relevance and importance -- this is often done through scoring and filtering\n",
    "- The system must be able to integrate multiple context sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Context Engineering is Iterative**\n",
    "- Systems improve as they gather more context -- though as we'll see in the course, there are limits\n",
    "- Context quality affects response quality\n",
    "- Feedback loops help refine context management\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll explore the **Project Overview** - diving deeper into the Redis University Class Agent architecture and seeing how all these concepts come together in a real implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we'll cover **Environment Setup** to get you ready for hands-on work with the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 Reflection: Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about AI systems you use daily (ChatGPT, virtual assistants, recommendation systems):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which ones remember your preferences across sessions?\n",
    "2. How does this memory affect your experience?\n",
    "3. What would happen if they forgot everything each time?\n",
    "4. Can you identify examples of good vs. poor context management?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider sharing your thoughts in the discussion forum or with fellow learners.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of context engineering lies in its ability to make AI systems more intelligent, personalized, and useful. As we'll see in the following notebooks, the technical implementation of these concepts using Redis, LangGraph, and modern AI tools makes it possible to build sophisticated, context-aware applications."

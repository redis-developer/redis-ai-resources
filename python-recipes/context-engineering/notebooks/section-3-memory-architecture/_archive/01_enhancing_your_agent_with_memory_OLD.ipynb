    "\n",
    "## From Grounding Problem to Memory Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, you experienced the **grounding problem** - how references break without memory. Now you'll enhance your existing RAG agent from Section 2 with memory capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enhance your existing `SimpleRAGAgent`** with memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🧠 Working Memory** - Session-scoped conversation context\n",
    "- **📚 Long-term Memory** - Cross-session knowledge and preferences  \n",
    "- **🔄 Memory Integration** - Seamless working + long-term memory\n",
    "- **⚡ Agent Memory Server** - Production-ready memory architecture\n",

    "### Context Engineering Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook teaches **memory-enhanced context engineering** by building on your existing agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reference Resolution** - Using memory to resolve pronouns and references\n",
    "2. **Memory-Aware Context Assembly** - How memory improves context quality\n",
    "3. **Personalized Context** - Leveraging long-term memory for personalization\n",
    "4. **Cross-Session Continuity** - Context that survives across conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. **Enhance** your existing RAG agent with memory capabilities\n",

    "- ❌ Session-bound memory\n",
    "- ❌ No reference resolution\n",
    "- ❌ Limited conversation history\n",
    "- ❌ No personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. WorkingMemoryRAGAgent (Step 3)**\n",
    "- ✅ Working memory for reference resolution\n",
    "- ✅ Solves grounding problem (\"it\", \"that\", \"you mentioned\")\n",
    "- ✅ Natural conversation flow\n",
    "- ✅ Session-scoped context continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. MemoryEnhancedRAGAgent (Step 5)**\n",

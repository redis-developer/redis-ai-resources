    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand** why memory is essential for context engineering\n",
    "2. **Implement** working memory for conversation continuity\n",
    "3. **Use** long-term memory for persistent user knowledge\n",
    "4. **Integrate** memory with your Section 2 RAG system\n",

    "## 🔗 Bridge from Sections 1 & 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Section 1: The Four Context Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the four context types from Section 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System Context** (Static) - Role, instructions, guidelines\n",
    "2. **User Context** (Dynamic, User-Specific) - Profile, preferences, goals\n",
    "3. **Conversation Context** (Dynamic, Session-Specific) - **← Memory enables this!**\n",
    "4. **Retrieved Context** (Dynamic, Query-Specific) - RAG results\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Section 2: Stateless RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Section 2 RAG system was **stateless**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def rag_query(query, student_profile):\n",
    "    # 1. Search courses (Retrieved Context)\n",
    "    courses = course_manager.search(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 2. Assemble context (System + User + Retrieved)\n",
    "    context = assemble_context(system_prompt, student_profile, courses)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 3. Generate response\n",
    "    response = llm.invoke(context)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # ❌ No conversation history stored\n",
    "    # ❌ Each query is independent\n",
    "    # ❌ Can't reference previous messages\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** Every query starts from scratch. No conversation continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚨 The Grounding Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grounding** means understanding what users are referring to. Natural conversation is full of references:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Without Memory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"Tell me about CS401\"\n",
    "Agent: \"CS401 is Machine Learning. It covers supervised learning...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"What are its prerequisites?\"\n",
    "Agent: ❌ \"What does 'its' refer to? Please specify which course.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"The course we just discussed!\"\n",
    "Agent: ❌ \"I don't have access to previous messages. Which course?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a terrible user experience.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **With Memory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"Tell me about CS401\"\n",
    "Agent: \"CS401 is Machine Learning. It covers...\"\n",
    "[Stores: User asked about CS401]\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"What are its prerequisites?\"\n",
    "Agent: [Checks memory: \"its\" = CS401]\n",
    "Agent: ✅ \"CS401 requires CS201 and MATH301\"\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"Can I take it?\"\n",
    "Agent: [Checks memory: \"it\" = CS401, checks student transcript]\n",
    "Agent: ✅ \"You've completed CS201 but still need MATH301\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now the conversation flows naturally!**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Two Types of Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Working Memory (Session-Scoped)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What:** Conversation messages from the current session\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Reference resolution, conversation continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lifetime:** Session duration (e.g., 1 hour TTL)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Session: session_123\n",
    "Messages:\n",
    "  1. User: \"Tell me about CS401\"\n",
    "  2. Agent: \"CS401 is Machine Learning...\"\n",
    "  3. User: \"What are its prerequisites?\"\n",
    "  4. Agent: \"CS401 requires CS201 and MATH301\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Long-term Memory (Cross-Session)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What:** Persistent facts, preferences, goals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Personalization across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lifetime:** Permanent (until explicitly deleted)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: student_sarah\n",
    "Memories:\n",
    "  - \"Prefers online courses over in-person\"\n",
    "  - \"Major: Computer Science, focus on AI/ML\"\n",
    "  - \"Goal: Graduate Spring 2026\"\n",
    "  - \"Completed: CS101, CS201, MATH301\"\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Memory Solves the Grounding Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without memory, agents can't resolve references:\n",
    "- ❌ \"What are **its** prerequisites?\" → Agent doesn't know what \"its\" refers to\n",
    "- ✅ With working memory → Agent resolves \"its\" from conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Two Types of Memory Serve Different Purposes**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working Memory (Session-Scoped):**\n",
    "- Conversation messages from current session\n",
    "- Enables reference resolution and conversation continuity\n",
    "- TTL-based (expires after session ends)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-term Memory (Cross-Session):**\n",
    "- Persistent facts, preferences, goals\n",
    "- Enables personalization across sessions\n",
    "- Searchable via semantic vector search\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Memory Completes the Four Context Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "From Section 1, we learned about four context types. Memory enables two of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System Context** (Static) - ✅ Section 2\n",
    "2. **User Context** (Dynamic, User-Specific) - ✅ Section 2 + Long-term Memory\n",
    "3. **Conversation Context** (Dynamic, Session-Specific) - ✨ **Working Memory**\n",
    "4. **Retrieved Context** (Dynamic, Query-Specific) - ✅ Section 2 RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Memory + RAG = Complete Context Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration pattern:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Load working memory (conversation history)\n",
    "2. Search long-term memory (user facts)\n",
    "3. RAG search (relevant documents)\n",
    "4. Assemble all context types\n",
    "5. Generate response\n",
    "6. Save working memory (updated conversation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us **stateful, personalized, context-aware conversations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Agent Memory Server is Production-Ready**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use Agent Memory Server instead of simple in-memory storage:\n",
    "- ✅ **Scalable** - Redis-backed, handles thousands of users\n",
    "- ✅ **Automatic** - Extracts important facts to long-term storage\n",
    "- ✅ **Semantic search** - Vector-indexed memory retrieval\n",
    "- ✅ **Deduplication** - Prevents redundant memories\n",
    "- ✅ **TTL management** - Automatic expiration of old sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. LangChain is Sufficient for Memory + RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't need LangGraph for this section because:\n",
    "- Simple linear flow (load → search → generate → save)\n",
    "- No conditional branching or complex state management\n",
    "- No tool calling required\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph becomes necessary in Section 4** when we add tools and multi-step workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Section 4: Tool Selection & Agentic Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have **memory-enhanced RAG**, you'll add **tools** to create a complete agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools You'll Add:**\n",
    "- `search_courses` - Semantic search (you already have this!)\n",
    "- `get_course_details` - Fetch specific course information\n",
    "- `check_prerequisites` - Verify student eligibility\n",
    "- `enroll_course` - Register student for a course\n",
    "- `store_memory` - Explicitly save important facts\n",
    "- `search_memories` - Query long-term memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why LangGraph in Section 4:**\n",
    "- **Tool calling** - Agent decides which tools to use\n",
    "- **Conditional branching** - Different paths based on tool results\n",
    "- **State management** - Track tool execution across steps\n",
    "- **Error handling** - Retry failed tool calls\n",

    "## 💪 Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 1: Cross-Session Personalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the `memory_enhanced_rag_query` function to:\n",
    "1. Store user preferences in long-term memory when mentioned\n",
    "2. Use those preferences in future sessions\n",
    "3. Test with two different sessions for the same student\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Look for phrases like \"I prefer...\", \"I like...\", \"I want...\" and store them as semantic memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 2: Memory-Aware Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhance the RAG search to use long-term memories as filters:\n",
    "1. Search long-term memory for preferences (format, difficulty, schedule)\n",
    "2. Apply those preferences as filters to `course_manager.search()`\n",
    "3. Compare results with and without memory-aware filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Use the `filters` parameter in `course_manager.search()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 3: Conversation Summarization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a function that summarizes long conversations:\n",
    "1. When working memory exceeds 10 messages, summarize the conversation\n",
    "2. Store the summary in long-term memory\n",
    "3. Clear old messages from working memory (keep only recent 4)\n",
    "4. Test that reference resolution still works with summarized history\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Use the LLM to generate summaries, then store as semantic memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 4: Multi-User Memory Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a simple CLI that:\n",
    "1. Supports multiple students (different user IDs)\n",
    "2. Maintains separate working memory per session\n",
    "3. Maintains separate long-term memory per user\n",
    "4. Demonstrates cross-session continuity for each user\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Use different `session_id` and `user_id` for each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 5: Memory Search Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with long-term memory search:\n",
    "1. Store 20+ diverse memories for a student\n",
    "2. Try different search queries\n",
    "3. Analyze which memories are retrieved\n",
    "4. Adjust memory text to improve search relevance\n",

    "### **Key Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `memory_enhanced_rag_query()` - Complete memory + RAG pipeline\n",
    "- `working_memory_demo()` - Demonstrates conversation continuity\n",
    "- `longterm_memory_demo()` - Demonstrates persistent knowledge\n",
    "- `complete_demo()` - End-to-end multi-turn conversation\n",

    "### **Architecture Pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Load Working Memory (conversation history)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Search Long-term Memory (user facts)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "RAG Search (relevant courses)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Assemble Context (System + User + Conversation + Retrieved)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Generate Response\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Save Working Memory (updated conversation)\n",

    "### **From Section 2 to Section 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 2 (Stateless RAG):**\n",
    "- ❌ No conversation history\n",
    "- ❌ Each query independent\n",
    "- ❌ Can't resolve references\n",
    "- ✅ Retrieves relevant documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 3 (Memory-Enhanced RAG):**\n",
    "- ✅ Conversation history (working memory)\n",
    "- ✅ Multi-turn conversations\n",
    "- ✅ Reference resolution\n",
    "- ✅ Persistent user knowledge (long-term memory)\n",
    "- ✅ Personalization across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 4** will add **tools** and **agentic workflows** using **LangGraph**, completing your journey from context engineering fundamentals to production-ready AI agents.\n",

    "- Resolves references naturally\n",
    "- Personalizes responses\n",
    "- Integrates all four context types\n",

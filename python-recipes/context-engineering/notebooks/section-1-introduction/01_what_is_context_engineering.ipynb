        "# What is Context Engineering?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "**Context Engineering** is the discipline of designing, implementing, and optimizing context management systems for AI agents and applications. It's the practice of ensuring that AI systems have the right information, at the right time, in the right format to make intelligent decisions and provide relevant responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of context engineering as the \"memory and awareness system\" for AI agents - it's what allows them to:\n",
        "- Remember past conversations and experiences\n",
        "- Understand their role and capabilities\n",
        "- Access relevant information from large knowledge bases\n",
        "- Maintain coherent, personalized interactions over time\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Context Engineering Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Without proper context engineering, AI agents are like people with severe amnesia - they can't remember what happened five minutes ago, don't know who they're talking to, and can't learn from experience. This leads to:\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ **Poor User Experience**\n",
        "- Repetitive conversations\n",
        "- Lack of personalization\n",
        "- Inconsistent responses\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ **Inefficient Operations**\n",
        "- Redundant processing\n",
        "- Inability to build on previous work\n",
        "- Lost context between sessions\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ **Limited Capabilities**\n",
        "- Can't handle complex, multi-step tasks\n",
        "- No learning or adaptation\n",
        "- Poor integration with existing systems\n",
        "\n",
        "## Core Components of Context Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "Context engineering involves several key components working together:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **System Context**\n",
        "What the AI should know about itself and its environment:\n",
        "- Role and responsibilities\n",
        "- Available tools and capabilities\n",
        "- Operating constraints and guidelines\n",
        "- Domain-specific knowledge\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Memory Management**\n",
        "How information is stored, retrieved, and maintained:\n",
        "- **Working memory**: Current conversation and immediate context\n",
        "- **Long-term memory**: Persistent knowledge and experiences\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Context Retrieval**\n",
        "How relevant information is found and surfaced:\n",
        "- Semantic search and similarity matching\n",
        "- Relevance ranking and filtering\n",
        "- Context window management\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Context Integration**\n",
        "How different types of context are combined:\n",
        "- Merging multiple information sources\n",
        "- Resolving conflicts and inconsistencies\n",
        "- Prioritizing information by importance\n",
        "\n",
        "## Real-World Example: University Class Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's explore context engineering through a practical example - a university class recommendation agent. This agent helps students find courses, plan their academic journey, and provides personalized recommendations.\n",

        "## Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "From this introduction to context engineering, we can see several important principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Context is Multi-Dimensional**\n",
        "- **System context**: What the AI knows about itself\n",
        "- **User context**: What the AI knows about the user\n",
        "- **Domain context**: What the AI knows about the subject matter\n",
        "- **Conversation context**: What has been discussed recently\n",
        "- **Historical context**: What has been learned over time\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Memory is Essential**\n",
        "- **Working memory**: Maintains conversation flow\n",
        "- **Long-term memory**: Enables learning and personalization\n",
        "- **Semantic memory**: Allows intelligent retrieval of relevant information\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Context Must Be Actionable**\n",
        "- Information is only valuable if it can be used to improve responses\n",
        "- Context should be prioritized by relevance and importance\n",
        "- The system must be able to integrate multiple context sources\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Context Engineering is Iterative**\n",
        "- Systems improve as they gather more context\n",
        "- Context quality affects response quality\n",
        "- Feedback loops help refine context management\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next notebook, we'll explore **The Role of a Context Engine** - the technical infrastructure that makes context engineering possible. We'll dive deeper into:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Vector databases and semantic search\n",
        "- Memory architectures and storage patterns\n",
        "- Context retrieval and ranking algorithms\n",
        "- Integration with LLMs and agent frameworks\n",
        "\n",
        "## Try It Yourself\n",
        "\n",
        "Experiment with the concepts we've covered:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modify the student profile** - Change interests, preferences, or academic history\n",
        "2. **Add new memory types** - Store different kinds of information\n",
        "3. **Experiment with context retrieval** - Try different queries and see what memories are retrieved\n",
        "4. **Think about your own use case** - How would context engineering apply to your domain?\n",
        "\n",
        "The power of context engineering lies in its ability to make AI systems more intelligent, personalized, and useful. As we'll see in the following notebooks, the technical implementation of these concepts using Redis, LangGraph, and modern AI tools makes it possible to build sophisticated, context-aware applications."

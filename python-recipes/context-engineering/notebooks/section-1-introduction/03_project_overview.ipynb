        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this course, we'll be building and exploring a complete **Redis University Class Agent** - a sophisticated AI agent that helps students find courses, plan their academic journey, and provides personalized recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project serves as a comprehensive example of context engineering principles in action, demonstrating how to build intelligent, context-aware AI systems using Redis, LangGraph, and modern AI tools.\n",

        "- **Remember student context** across multiple conversations and sessions\n",
        "- **Answer questions** about courses, prerequisites, and academic planning\n",
        "- **Adapt and learn** from student interactions over time\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📚 **Educational Objectives**\n",
        "- **Demonstrate context engineering concepts** in a real-world scenario\n",
        "- **Show Redis capabilities** for AI applications and memory management\n",
        "- **Illustrate LangGraph workflows** for complex agent behaviors\n",

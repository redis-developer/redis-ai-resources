    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "From this introduction to context engineering, we can see several important principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Context is Multi-Dimensional\n",
    "- **System context**: What the AI knows about itself\n",
    "- **User context**: What the AI knows about the user\n",
    "- **Domain context**: What the AI knows about the subject matter\n",
    "- **Conversation context**: What has been discussed recently\n",
    "- **Historical context**: What has been learned over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these sources are static, updated only when the agent's code changes, while others may be retrieved dynamically from external sources, such as via APIs or vector search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Memory is Essential\n",
    "- **Working memory**: Maintains conversation flow and task-related context\n",
    "- **Long-term memory**: Enables learning and personalization across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Context Must Be Actionable\n",
    "- Information is only valuable if it can improve responses\n",
    "- Context should be prioritized by relevance and importance\n",
    "- The system must be able to integrate multiple context sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Context Engineering is Iterative\n",
    "- Systems improve as they gather more context\n",
    "- Context quality affects response quality\n",
    "- Feedback loops help refine context management\n"

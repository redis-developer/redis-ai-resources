    "## 🔗 Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Section 1: The Four Context Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the four context types from Section 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System Context** (Static) - Role, instructions, guidelines\n",
    "2. **User Context** (Dynamic, User-Specific) - Profile, preferences, goals\n",
    "3. **Conversation Context** (Dynamic, Session-Specific) - **← Memory enables this!**\n",
    "4. **Retrieved Context** (Dynamic, Query-Specific) - RAG results\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Section 2: Stateless RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Section 2 RAG system was **stateless**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def rag_query(query, student_profile):\n",
    "    # 1. Search courses (Retrieved Context)\n",
    "    courses = await course_manager.search_courses(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 2. Assemble context (System + User + Retrieved)\n",
    "    context = assemble_context(system_prompt, student_profile, courses)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 3. Generate response\n",
    "    response = llm.invoke(context)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # ❌ No conversation history stored\n",
    "    # ❌ Each query is independent\n",
    "    # ❌ Can't reference previous messages\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** Every query starts from scratch. No conversation continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚨 Why Agents Need Memory: The Grounding Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into implementation, let's understand the fundamental problem that memory solves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grounding** means understanding what users are referring to. Natural conversation is full of references:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Without Memory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"Tell me about CS401\"\n",
    "Agent: \"CS401 is Machine Learning. It covers supervised learning...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"What are its prerequisites?\"\n",
    "Agent: ❌ \"What does 'it' refer to? Please specify which course.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"The course we just discussed!\"\n",
    "Agent: ❌ \"I don't have access to previous messages. Which course?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a terrible user experience.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of References That Need Grounding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pronouns:**\n",
    "- \"it\", \"that course\", \"those\", \"this one\"\n",
    "- \"he\", \"she\", \"they\" (referring to people)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptions:**\n",
    "- \"the easy one\", \"the online course\"\n",
    "- \"my advisor\", \"that professor\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implicit context:**\n",
    "- \"Can I take it?\" → Take what?\n",
    "- \"When does it start?\" → What starts?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal references:**\n",
    "- \"you mentioned\", \"earlier\", \"last time\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **With Memory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"Tell me about CS401\"\n",
    "Agent: \"CS401 is Machine Learning. It covers...\"\n",
    "[Stores: User asked about CS401]\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"What are its prerequisites?\"\n",
    "Agent: [Checks memory: \"its\" = CS401]\n",
    "Agent: ✅ \"CS401 requires CS201 and MATH301\"\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"Can I take it?\"\n",
    "Agent: [Checks memory: \"it\" = CS401, checks student transcript]\n",
    "Agent: ✅ \"You've completed CS201 but still need MATH301\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now the conversation flows naturally!**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Two Types of Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Working Memory (Session-Scoped)**\n",
    "\n",
    " - **What:** Conversation messages from the current session\n",
    " - **Purpose:** Reference resolution, conversation continuity\n",
    " - **Lifetime:** Persists for the session\n",
    " - **Storage:** Conversation remains accessible when you return to the same session\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Session: session_123\n",
    "Messages:\n",
    "  1. User: \"Tell me about CS401\"\n",
    "  2. Agent: \"CS401 is Machine Learning...\"\n",
    "  3. User: \"What are its prerequisites?\"\n",
    "  4. Agent: \"CS401 requires CS201 and MATH301\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point:** Just like ChatGPT or Claude, when you return to a conversation, the working memory is still there. The conversation doesn't disappear!\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Long-term Memory (Cross-Session)**\n",
    "\n",
    " - **What:** Persistent knowledge (user preferences, domain facts, business rules)\n",
    " - **Purpose:** Personalization AND consistent application behavior across sessions\n",
    " - **Lifetime:** Permanent (until explicitly deleted)\n",
    " - **Scope:** Can be user-specific OR application-wide\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**User-Scoped (Personalization):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: student_sarah\n",
    "  - \"Prefers online courses over in-person\"\n",
    "  - \"Major: Computer Science, focus on AI/ML\"\n",
    "  - \"Goal: Graduate Spring 2026\"\n",
    "  - \"Completed: CS101, CS201, MATH301\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application-Scoped (Domain Knowledge):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Domain: course_requirements\n",
    "  - \"CS401 requires CS201 as prerequisite\"\n",
    "  - \"Maximum course load is 18 credits per semester\"\n",
    "  - \"Registration opens 2 weeks before semester start\"\n",
    "  - \"Lab courses require campus attendance\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Comparison: Working vs. Long-term Memory**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Working Memory | Long-term Memory |\n",
    "|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Session-scoped** | **User-scoped OR Application-scoped** |\n",
    "| Current conversation | Important facts, rules, knowledge |\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's set up our environment with the necessary dependencies and connections. We'll build on Section 2's RAG foundation and add memory capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before running this notebook, make sure you have:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Docker Desktop running** - Required for Redis and Agent Memory Server\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Environment variables** - Create a `.env` file in the `reference-agent` directory:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Copy the example file\n",
    "   cd ../../reference-agent\n",
    "   cp .env.example .env\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key\n",
    "   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the setup script** - This will automatically start Redis and Agent Memory Server:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd ../../reference-agent\n",
    "   python setup_agent_memory_server.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The setup script will:\n",
    "- ✅ Check if Docker is running\n",
    "- ✅ Start Redis if not running (port 6379)\n",
    "- ✅ Start Agent Memory Server if not running (port 8088)\n",
    "- ✅ Verify Redis connection is working\n",
    "- ✅ Handle any configuration issues automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Memory Server is not available, the notebook will skip memory-related demos but will still run.\n"

    "### 📊 What Happened:\n",
    "**Turn 1:** 'Tell me about Data Structures and Algorithms'\n",
    "- Working memory: empty (first turn)\n",
    "- Stored query and response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Turn 2:** 'What are its prerequisites?'\n",
    "- Working memory: 1 exchange (Turn 1)\n",
    "- LLM resolved 'its' → Data Structures and Algorithms using history\n",
    "- Generated accurate response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Turn 3:** 'Can I take it next semester?'\n",
    "- Working memory: 2 exchanges (Turns 1-2)\n",
    "- LLM resolved 'it' → Data Structures and Algorithms using history\n",
    "- Maintained conversation continuity\n",

    "#### ✅ Key Benefits:\n",
    "- Natural conversation flow\n",
    "- Pronoun reference resolution\n",
    "- No need to repeat context\n",
    "- Seamless user experience\n",

    "#### ❌ Without Working Memory:\n",
    "- 'What are its prerequisites?' → 'What is its?' Or \"General information without data from the LLM's training\"\n",

    "# 📚 Part 2: Long-term Memory for Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Long-term Memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memory enables AI agents to store **persistent knowledge** across sessions—including user preferences, domain facts, business rules, and system configuration. This is crucial for context engineering because it allows agents to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personalize** interactions by remembering user-specific preferences and history\n",
    "- **Apply domain knowledge** consistently (prerequisites, policies, regulations)\n",
    "- **Maintain organizational context** (business rules, schedules, procedures)\n",
    "- **Search efficiently** using semantic vector search across all knowledge types\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memory is a flexible storage mechanism: user-scoped memories enable personalization (\"Student prefers online courses\"), while application-scoped memories provide consistent behavior for everyone (\"CS401 requires CS201\", \"Registration opens 2 weeks before semester\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Session 1: User shares preferences → Store in long-term memory\n",
    "Session 2: User asks for recommendations → Search memory → Personalized response\n",
    "Session 3: User updates preferences → Update memory accordingly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Three Types of Long-term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent Memory Server supports three distinct memory types, each optimized for different kinds of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Semantic Memory - Facts and Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Store timeless facts, preferences, and knowledge independent of when they were learned. Can be user-scoped (personalization) or application-scoped (domain knowledge).\n",
    "\n",
    "**User-Scoped Examples:**\n",
    "- \"Student's major is Computer Science\"\n",
    "- \"Student prefers online courses\"\n",
    "- \"Student wants to graduate in Spring 2026\"\n",
    "- \"Student is interested in machine learning\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application-Scoped Examples:**\n",
    "- \"CS401 requires CS201 and MATH301 as prerequisites\"\n",
    "- \"Online courses have asynchronous discussion forums\"\n",
    "- \"Academic advisors are available Monday-Friday 9am-5pm\"\n",
    "- \"Maximum file upload size for assignments is 50MB\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:** Information that remains true regardless of time context, whether user-specific or universally applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Episodic Memory - Events and Experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Store time-bound events and experiences where sequence matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- \"Student enrolled in CS101 on 2024-09-15\"\n",
    "- \"Student completed CS101 with grade A on 2024-12-10\"\n",
    "- \"Student asked about machine learning courses on 2024-09-20\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:** Timeline-based information where timing or sequence is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Message Memory - Context-Rich Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Store full conversation snippets where complete context is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Detailed career planning discussion with nuanced advice\n",
    "- Professor's specific guidance about research opportunities\n",
    "- Student's explanation of personal learning challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:** When summary would lose important nuance, tone, or exact wording.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Use sparingly** - Message memories are token-expensive!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Choosing the Right Memory Type\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself these questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Can you extract a simple fact?** → Use **Semantic**\n",
    "2. **Does timing matter?** → Use **Episodic**\n",
    "3. **Is full context crucial?** → Use **Message** (rarely)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default strategy: Prefer Semantic** - they're compact, searchable, and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Reference Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Information Type | Memory Type | Example |\n",
    "|-----------------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| Preference | Semantic | \"Prefers morning classes\" |\n",
    "| Fact | Semantic | \"Major is Computer Science\" |\n",

    "### Scenario 1: Student States Preference\n",
    "\n",
    "**User says:** \"I prefer online courses because I work during the day.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Wrong - Message memory (too verbose):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "memory = \"Student said: 'I prefer online courses because I work during the day.'\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Right - Semantic memories (extracted facts):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "memory1 = \"Student prefers online courses\"\n",
    "memory2 = \"Student works during the day\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Simple facts don't need verbatim storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 2: Course Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "**User says:** \"I just finished CS101 last week!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Wrong - Semantic (loses temporal context):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "memory = \"Student completed CS101\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Right - Episodic (preserves timeline):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "memory = \"Student completed CS101 on 2024-10-20\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Timeline matters for prerequisites and future planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 3: Complex Career Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** 20-message discussion about career path including nuanced advice about research vs. industry, application timing, and specific companies to target.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Wrong - Semantic (loses too much context):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "memory = \"Student discussed career planning\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Right - Message memory (preserves full context):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "memory = [Full conversation thread with all nuance]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Details and context are critical; summary would be inadequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Most memories should be semantic** - efficient and searchable\n",
    "- **Use episodic when sequence matters** - track progress and timeline\n",
    "- **Use message rarely** - only when context cannot be summarized\n",
    "- **Effective memory selection improves personalization** and reduces token usage\n",

    "\n",
    "Understanding how working memory and long-term memory persist is crucial for building reliable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Working Memory Persistence**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:** Just like ChatGPT or Claude conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means:**\n",
    "- When you return to a conversation, the working memory is still there\n",
    "- The conversation doesn't disappear when you close the tab\n",
    "- Full conversation history remains accessible within the session\n",
    "- **Backend optimization:** TTL for storage management (not user-facing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Experience:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Day 1, 10:00 AM - User starts conversation\n",
    "Day 1, 10:25 AM - User closes browser\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "[User returns later]\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Day 1, 3:00 PM - User reopens conversation\n",
    "                 → Working memory still there ✅\n",
    "                 → Conversation continues naturally ✅\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Real Challenge: Context Window Limits**\n",
    "\n",
    "Working memory doesn't \"expire\" - but it can grow too large:\n",
    "- LLMs have context window limits (e.g., 128K tokens for GPT-4)\n",
    "- Long conversations eventually exceed these limits\n",
    "- **Solution:** Compression strategies (covered in Notebook 03)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Long-term Memory Persistence**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lifetime:** Indefinite (until manually deleted)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means:**\n",
    "- Long-term memories never expire automatically\n",
    "- Accessible across all sessions, forever\n",
    "- Must be explicitly deleted if no longer needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Design?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working Memory (Session-Persistent):**\n",
    "- Stores full conversation history for the session\n",
    "- Persists when you return to the conversation (like ChatGPT)\n",
    "- **Challenge:** Can grow too large for context window\n",
    "- **Solution:** Compression strategies (Notebook 03)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-term Memory (Cross-Session Persistent):**\n",
    "- Important facts extracted from conversations\n",
    "- User preferences don't expire\n",
    "- Knowledge accumulates over time\n",
    "- Enables true personalization across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Important Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Automatic Extraction to Long-term Memory**\n",
    "\n",
    "Important facts from conversations are automatically extracted to long-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good news:** Agent Memory Server does this automatically in the background!\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Long-term Memories are Permanent**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once stored, long-term memories persist indefinitely. Be thoughtful about what you store.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Cross-Session Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Session 1 (Day 1):\n",
    "- User: \"I'm interested in machine learning\"\n",
    "- Working memory: Stores full conversation\n",
    "- Long-term memory: Extracts \"Student interested in machine learning\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[User starts a NEW session on Day 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Session 2 (Day 3):\n",
    "- Working memory: NEW session, starts empty ✅\n",
    "- Long-term memory: Still has \"Student interested in machine learning\" ✅\n",
    "- Agent retrieves long-term memory for personalization ✅\n",
    "- Agent makes relevant recommendations ✅\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Distinction:**\n",
    "- **Same session:** Working memory persists (like returning to a ChatGPT conversation)\n",
    "- **New session:** Working memory starts fresh, but long-term memories are available\n",

    "### Available Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent Memory Server supports four memory extraction strategies that determine how memories are created:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Discrete Strategy (Default)** ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Extract individual facts and preferences from conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best For:** General-purpose memory extraction, factual information, user preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Input (Conversation):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"I'm a Computer Science major interested in machine learning. I prefer online courses.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Output (Long-term Memories):**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"semantic\",\n",
    "    \"text\": \"User's major is Computer Science\",\n",
    "    \"topics\": [\"education\", \"major\"],\n",
    "    \"entities\": [\"Computer Science\"]\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"semantic\",\n",
    "    \"text\": \"User interested in machine learning\",\n",
    "    \"topics\": [\"interests\", \"technology\"],\n",
    "    \"entities\": [\"machine learning\"]\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"semantic\",\n",

    "    \"topics\": [\"preferences\", \"learning\"],\n",
    "    \"entities\": [\"online courses\"]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "- ✅ Most agent interactions (default choice)\n",
    "- ✅ When you want searchable individual facts\n",
    "- ✅ When facts should be independently retrievable\n",
    "- ✅ Building knowledge graphs or fact databases\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Summary Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Create concise summaries of entire conversations instead of extracting discrete facts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best For:** Long conversations, meeting notes, comprehensive context preservation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Input (Same Conversation):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"I'm a Computer Science major interested in machine learning. I prefer online courses.\"\n",

    "  \"entities\": [\"Computer Science\", \"machine learning\", \"online courses\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "- ✅ Long consultations or advising sessions\n",
    "- ✅ Meeting notes or session summaries\n",
    "- ✅ When context of entire conversation matters\n",
    "- ✅ Reducing storage while preserving conversational context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Preferences Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Focus specifically on extracting user preferences and personal characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best For:** Personalization systems, user profile building, preference learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Output:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"type\": \"semantic\",\n",
    "  \"text\": \"User prefers online courses over in-person instruction\",\n",

    "- ✅ Personalization-focused applications\n",
    "- ✅ Preference learning systems\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Custom Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Use domain-specific extraction prompts for specialized needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best For:** Domain-specific extraction (technical, legal, medical), specialized workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Note:** ⚠️ Custom prompts require validation to prevent prompt injection attacks. See the [Security Guide](https://redis.github.io/agent-memory-server/security/) for details.\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Memory Solves the Grounding Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without memory, agents can't resolve references:\n",
    "- ❌ \"What are **its** prerequisites?\" → Agent doesn't know what \"its\" refers to\n",
    "- ✅ With working memory → Agent resolves \"its\" from conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Two Types of Memory Serve Different Purposes**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working Memory (Session-Scoped):**\n",
    "- Conversation messages from current session\n",
    "- Enables reference resolution and conversation continuity\n",
    "- Persists within the session (like ChatGPT conversations)\n",
    "- Challenge: Can grow too large for context window limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-term Memory (Cross-Session):**\n",
    "- Persistent knowledge: user preferences, domain facts, business rules\n",
    "- Enables personalization AND consistent application behavior\n",
    "- Can be user-scoped (personalization) or application-scoped (domain knowledge)\n",
    "- Searchable via semantic vector search\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Memory Completes the Four Context Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "From Section 1, we learned about four context types. Memory enables two of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System Context** (Static) - ✅ Section 2\n",
    "2. **User Context** (Dynamic, User-Specific) - ✅ Section 2 + Long-term Memory\n",
    "3. **Conversation Context** (Dynamic, Session-Specific) - ✨ **Working Memory**\n",
    "4. **Retrieved Context** (Dynamic, Query-Specific) - ✅ Section 2 RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Memory + RAG = Complete Context Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration pattern:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Load working memory (conversation history)\n",
    "2. Search long-term memory (user facts)\n",
    "3. RAG search (relevant documents)\n",
    "4. Assemble all context types\n",
    "5. Generate response\n",
    "6. Save working memory (updated conversation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us **stateful, personalized, context-aware conversations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Agent Memory Server is Production-Ready**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use Agent Memory Server instead of simple in-memory storage:\n",
    "- ✅ **Scalable** - Redis-backed, handles thousands of users\n",
    "- ✅ **Automatic** - Extracts important facts to long-term storage\n",
    "- ✅ **Semantic search** - Vector-indexed memory retrieval\n",
    "- ✅ **Deduplication** - Prevents redundant memories\n",
    "- ✅ **Session management** - Efficient storage and retrieval of conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. LangChain is Sufficient for Memory + RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't need LangGraph for this section because:\n",
    "- Simple linear flow (load → search → generate → save)\n",
    "- No conditional branching or complex state management\n",
    "- No tool calling required\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph becomes necessary in Section 4** when we add tools and multi-step workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Memory Management Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose the Right Memory Type:**\n",
    "- **Semantic** for facts and preferences (most common)\n",
    "- **Episodic** for time-bound events and timeline\n",
    "- **Message** for context-rich conversations (use sparingly)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understand Memory Lifecycle:**\n",
    "- **Working memory:** Session-scoped, persists within session\n",
    "- **Long-term memory:** Indefinite persistence, user-scoped, cross-session\n",
    "- **Automatic extraction:** Trust the system to extract important facts\n",
    "- **Context window limits:** Working memory can grow too large (use compression strategies)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Proper Memory Management:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Natural conversations** - Users don't repeat themselves\n",
    "- ✅ **Cross-session personalization** - Knowledge persists over time\n",
    "- ✅ **Efficient storage** - Automatic deduplication prevents bloat\n",
    "- ✅ **Semantic search** - Find relevant memories without exact keywords\n",
    "- ✅ **Scalable** - Redis-backed, production-ready architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Principle:** Memory transforms stateless RAG into stateful, personalized, context-aware conversations.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 💪 Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 1: Cross-Session Personalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the `memory_enhanced_rag_query` function to:\n",
    "1. Store user preferences in long-term memory when mentioned\n",
    "2. Use those preferences in future sessions\n",
    "3. Test with two different sessions for the same student\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Look for phrases like \"I prefer...\", \"I like...\", \"I want...\" and store them as semantic memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 2: Memory-Aware Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhance the RAG search to use long-term memories as filters:\n",
    "1. Search long-term memory for preferences (format, difficulty, schedule)\n",
    "2. Apply those preferences as filters to `course_manager.search_courses()`\n",
    "3. Compare results with and without memory-aware filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Use the `filters` parameter in `course_manager.search_courses()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 3: Conversation Summarization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a function that summarizes long conversations:\n",
    "1. When working memory exceeds 10 messages, summarize the conversation\n",
    "2. Store the summary in long-term memory\n",
    "3. Clear old messages from working memory (keep only recent 4)\n",
    "4. Test that reference resolution still works with summarized history\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Use the LLM to generate summaries, then store as semantic memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 4: Multi-User Memory Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a simple CLI that:\n",
    "1. Supports multiple students (different user IDs)\n",
    "2. Maintains separate working memory per session\n",
    "3. Maintains separate long-term memory per user\n",
    "4. Demonstrates cross-session continuity for each user\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Use different `session_id` and `user_id` for each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 5: Memory Search Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with long-term memory search:\n",
    "1. Store 20+ diverse memories for a student\n",
    "2. Try different search queries\n",
    "3. Analyze which memories are retrieved\n",
    "4. Adjust memory text to improve search relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** More specific memory text leads to better semantic search results.\n",

    "- ✅ Complete memory-enhanced RAG system\n",
    "- ✅ Integration of all four context types\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `memory_enhanced_rag_query()` - Complete memory + RAG pipeline\n",
    "- `working_memory_demo()` - Demonstrates conversation continuity\n",
    "- `longterm_memory_demo()` - Demonstrates persistent knowledge\n",
    "- `complete_demo()` - End-to-end multi-turn conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Architecture Pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Load Working Memory (conversation history)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Search Long-term Memory (user facts)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "RAG Search (relevant courses)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Assemble Context (System + User + Conversation + Retrieved)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Generate Response\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Save Working Memory (updated conversation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **From Section 2 to Section 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 2 (Stateless RAG):**\n",
    "- ❌ No conversation history\n",
    "- ❌ Each query independent\n",
    "- ❌ Can't resolve references\n",
    "- ✅ Retrieves relevant documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 3 (Memory-Enhanced RAG):**\n",
    "- ✅ Conversation history (working memory)\n",
    "- ✅ Multi-turn conversations\n",
    "- ✅ Reference resolution\n",
    "- ✅ Persistent user knowledge (long-term memory)\n",
    "- ✅ Personalization across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 4** will add **tools** and **agentic workflows** using **LangGraph**, completing your journey from context engineering fundamentals to production-ready AI agents.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to craft effective system prompts that define your agent's behavior, personality, and capabilities. System instructions are the foundation of your agent's context - they tell the LLM what it is, what it can do, and how it should behave.\n",

    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- What system instructions are and why they matter\n",
    "- What belongs in system context vs. retrieved context\n",
    "- How to structure effective system prompts\n",

    "## Concepts: System Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are System Instructions?\n",
    "\n",
    "System instructions (also called system prompts) are the **persistent context** that defines your agent's identity and behavior. They are included in every conversation turn and tell the LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Who it is** - Role and identity\n",
    "2. **What it can do** - Capabilities and tools\n",
    "3. **How it should behave** - Personality and constraints\n",
    "4. **What it knows** - Domain knowledge and context\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Context vs. Retrieved Context\n",
    "\n",
    "| System Context | Retrieved Context |\n",
    "|----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Static** - Same for every turn | **Dynamic** - Changes per query |\n",
    "| **Role & behavior** | **Specific facts** |\n",
    "| **Always included** | **Conditionally included** |\n",
    "| **Examples:** Agent role, capabilities, guidelines | **Examples:** Course details, user preferences, memories |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why System Instructions Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Good system instructions:\n",
    "- ✅ Keep the agent focused on its purpose\n",
    "- ✅ Prevent unwanted behaviors\n",
    "- ✅ Ensure consistent personality\n",
    "- ✅ Guide tool usage\n",
    "- ✅ Set user expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor system instructions:\n",
    "- ❌ Lead to off-topic responses\n",
    "- ❌ Cause inconsistent behavior\n",
    "- ❌ Result in tool misuse\n",
    "- ❌ Create confused or unhelpful agents"

      "\n",
      "3. **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):**\n",
      "   - **Key Concepts:** Understand the different types of NoSQL databases—document stores, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases.\n",
      "   - **Examples:** Familiarize yourself with popular NoSQL databases like MongoDB (document store), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (column-family), and Neo4j (graph).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Database Design:**\n",
      "   - **Normalization:** Learn about database normalization to organize tables efficiently and reduce redundancy.\n",

      "   - **Schema Design:** Practice designing schemas based on application requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Practical Experience:**\n",
      "   - **Hands-On Practice:** Use tools like MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin for PostgreSQL, or MongoDB Compass for MongoDB to experiment with queries and database design.\n",
      "   - **Build Projects:** Create simple projects like a library management system or a personal finance tracker to apply what you’ve learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Learning Resources:**\n",
      "   - **Books:** Consider books like \"Learning SQL\" by Alan Beaulieu or \"NoSQL Distilled\" by Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin Fowler.\n",
      "   - **Online Courses:** Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or Khan Academy offer courses on databases and SQL.\n",
      "   - **Documentation:** Read the official documentation for databases you’re interested in, as they often provide tutorials and examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Advanced Topics (Optional):**\n",
      "   - **Database Administration:** Learn about backup, recovery, performance tuning, and security.\n",
      "   - **Distributed Databases:** Understand how distributed databases work and explore systems like Apache Cassandra or Google Cloud Spanner.\n",
      "   - **Data Warehousing:** Explore concepts related to data warehousing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.\n",
      "\n",

    "\n",
    "✅ **Do:**\n",
    "- Be specific about the agent's role\n",
    "- Include clear behavioral guidelines\n",
    "- Set boundaries for out-of-scope requests\n",
    "- Use examples to clarify expected behavior\n",
    "- Keep instructions concise but complete\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't:**\n",
    "- Include dynamic data (use retrieved context instead)\n",
    "- Make instructions too long (wastes tokens)\n",
    "- Be vague about capabilities\n",
    "- Forget to set constraints\n",
    "- Include contradictory guidelines"

    "1. **Modify the system instructions** to make the agent more formal and academic in tone. Test it with a few queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add a constraint** that the agent should always ask about the student's year (freshman, sophomore, etc.) before recommending courses. Test if it follows this constraint.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Test edge cases**: Try to make the agent break its guidelines. What happens? How can you improve the instructions?"

    "\n",
    "- ✅ System instructions define your agent's identity, capabilities, and behavior\n",
    "- ✅ System context is static (same every turn) vs. retrieved context is dynamic\n",
    "- ✅ Good instructions include: role, capabilities, guidelines, constraints, and examples\n",
    "- ✅ Instructions significantly affect agent behavior and consistency\n",
    "- ✅ Start simple and iterate based on testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In the next notebook, we'll define tools that give our agent actual capabilities to search courses and check prerequisites."

        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to implement **working memory** with configurable **long-term extraction strategies** that inform memory management tools about when and how to extract important information from working memory to long-term storage.\n",

        "### Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Working Memory**: Persistent storage for task-focused context (conversation messages, task-related data)\n",
        "- **Long-term Memory**: Cross-session knowledge (user preferences, important facts learned over time)\n",
        "- **Long-Term Extraction Strategy**: Configurable logic for when/how to move important information from working to long-term memory\n",
        "- **Strategy-Aware Tools**: Memory tools that understand the extraction strategy and make intelligent decisions\n",
        "- **Context-Informed LLM**: The LLM receives information about the extraction strategy to make better memory management decisions\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Problem We're Solving\n",

        "Previously, memory tools like `add_memories_to_working_memory` and `create_memory` operated without knowledge of:\n",
        "- When memories should be extracted from working memory\n",
        "- What criteria determine memory importance\n",
        "- How the working memory's extraction strategy affects tool behavior\n",

        "1. **Custom Extraction Strategies**: Implement time-based, importance-threshold, or conversation-end strategies\n",
        "2. **Advanced Importance Calculation**: Use NLP techniques for better importance scoring\n",
        "3. **Multi-Modal Memory**: Extend to handle different types of content (text, images, etc.)\n",
        "4. **Memory Hierarchies**: Implement multiple levels of memory with different retention policies\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight is that **memory tools should be aware of the memory management strategy** to make intelligent decisions about when and how to store information."

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn about long-term memory - persistent knowledge that survives across sessions. While working memory handles the current conversation, long-term memory stores important facts, preferences, and experiences that should be remembered indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- What long-term memory is and why it's essential\n",
    "- The three types of long-term memories: semantic, episodic, and message\n",
    "- How to store and retrieve long-term memories\n",
    "- How semantic search works with memories\n",
    "- How automatic deduplication prevents redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",

    "## Concepts: Long-term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Long-term Memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memory is **persistent, cross-session knowledge** about users, preferences, and important facts. Unlike working memory (which is session-scoped), long-term memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Survives across sessions\n",
    "- ✅ Accessible from any conversation\n",
    "- ✅ Searchable via semantic vector search\n",
    "- ✅ Automatically deduplicated\n",
    "- ✅ Organized by user/namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working Memory vs. Long-term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "| Working Memory | Long-term Memory |\n",
    "|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Session-scoped** | **User-scoped** |\n",
    "| Current conversation | Important facts |\n",
    "| TTL-based (expires) | Persistent |\n",
    "| Full message history | Extracted knowledge |\n",
    "| Loaded/saved each turn | Searched when needed |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Types of Long-term Memories\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent Memory Server supports three types of long-term memories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Memory** - Facts and knowledge\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student prefers online courses\"\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student's major is Computer Science\"\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student wants to graduate in 2026\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Episodic Memory** - Events and experiences\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student enrolled in CS101 on 2024-09-15\"\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student asked about machine learning on 2024-09-20\"\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student completed Data Structures course\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Message Memory** - Important conversation snippets\n",
    "   - Example: Full conversation about career goals\n",
    "   - Example: Detailed discussion about course preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Semantic Search Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memories are stored with vector embeddings, enabling semantic search:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query: \"What does the student like?\"\n",
    "- Finds: \"Student prefers online courses\", \"Student enjoys programming\"\n",
    "- Even though exact words don't match!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Deduplication\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent Memory Server automatically prevents duplicate memories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hash-based**: Exact duplicates are rejected\n",
    "- **Semantic**: Similar memories are merged\n",
    "- Keeps memory storage efficient"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Long-term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Store in long-term memory:\n",
    "- ✅ User preferences and settings\n",
    "- ✅ Important facts about the user\n",
    "- ✅ Goals and objectives\n",
    "- ✅ Significant events and milestones\n",
    "- ✅ Completed courses and achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't store in long-term memory:\n",
    "- ❌ Temporary conversation context\n",
    "- ❌ Trivial details\n",
    "- ❌ Information that changes frequently\n",
    "- ❌ Sensitive data without proper handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Types Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic (Facts):**\n",
    "- \"Student prefers X\"\n",
    "- \"Student's major is Y\"\n",
    "- \"Student wants to Z\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Episodic (Events):**\n",
    "- \"Student enrolled in X on DATE\"\n",
    "- \"Student completed Y with grade Z\"\n",
    "- \"Student asked about X on DATE\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message (Conversations):**\n",
    "- Important conversation snippets\n",
    "- Detailed discussions worth preserving\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use descriptive topics** - Makes filtering easier\n",
    "2. **Add metadata** - Especially for episodic memories\n",
    "3. **Write clear memory text** - Will be searched semantically\n",
    "4. **Let deduplication work** - Don't worry about duplicates\n",
    "5. **Search before storing** - Check if similar memory exists"

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store your own memories**: Create 5 semantic and 3 episodic memories about a fictional student. Search for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test semantic search**: Create memories with different wordings but similar meanings. Search with various queries to see what matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explore metadata**: Add rich metadata to episodic memories. How can you use this in your agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cross-session test**: Create a memory, close the notebook, restart, and verify the memory persists."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Long-term memory stores persistent, cross-session knowledge\n",
    "- ✅ Three types: semantic (facts), episodic (events), message (conversations)\n",
    "- ✅ Semantic search enables natural language queries\n",
    "- ✅ Automatic deduplication prevents redundancy\n",
    "- ✅ Memories are user-scoped and accessible from any session\n",

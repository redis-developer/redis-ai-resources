# Redis Context Course

A complete reference implementation of a context-aware AI agent for university course recommendations and academic planning. This package demonstrates key context engineering concepts using Redis, LangGraph, and OpenAI.

## Features

- üß† **Dual Memory System**: Short-term (conversation) and long-term (persistent) memory
- üîç **Semantic Search**: Vector-based course discovery and recommendations
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Integration**: Extensible tool system for course search and memory management
- üí¨ **Context Awareness**: Maintains student preferences, goals, and conversation history
- üéØ **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-powered course suggestions based on student profile
- üìö **Course Catalog Management**: Complete system for storing and retrieving course information

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install redis-context-course
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-ai-resources.git
cd redis-ai-resources/python-recipes/context-engineering/reference-agent
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key and Redis URL
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
```

### 2. Start Redis

For local development:
```bash
# Using Docker
docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack:latest

# Or install Redis Stack locally
# See: https://redis.io/docs/stack/get-started/install/
```

### 3. Generate Sample Data

```bash
generate-courses --courses-per-major 15 --output course_catalog.json
```

### 4. Ingest Data into Redis

```bash
ingest-courses --catalog course_catalog.json --clear
```

### 5. Start the Agent

```bash
redis-class-agent --student-id your_student_id
```

## Python API Usage

```python
import asyncio
from redis_context_course import ClassAgent, MemoryManager, CourseManager

async def main():
    # Initialize the agent
    agent = ClassAgent("student_123")

    # Chat with the agent
    response = await agent.chat("I'm interested in machine learning courses")
    print(response)

    # Use individual components
    memory_manager = MemoryManager("student_123")
    await memory_manager.store_preference("I prefer online courses")

    course_manager = CourseManager()
    courses = await course_manager.search_courses("programming")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Agent**: LangGraph-based workflow orchestration
- **Memory Manager**: Handles both short-term and long-term memory
- **Course Manager**: Course storage and recommendation engine
- **Models**: Data structures for courses, students, and memory
- **Redis Config**: Redis connections and index management

### Command Line Tools

After installation, you have access to these command-line tools:

- `redis-class-agent`: Interactive chat interface with the agent
- `generate-courses`: Generate sample course catalog data
- `ingest-courses`: Load course data into Redis

### Memory System

The agent uses a dual-memory architecture:

1. **Short-term Memory**: Managed by LangGraph's Redis checkpointer
   - Conversation history
   - Current session state
   - Temporary context

2. **Long-term Memory**: Stored in Redis with vector embeddings
   - Student preferences and goals
   - Conversation summaries
   - Important experiences
   - Semantic search capabilities

### Tool System

The agent has access to several tools:

- `search_courses_tool`: Find courses based on queries and filters
- `get_recommendations_tool`: Get personalized course recommendations
- `store_preference_tool`: Save student preferences
- `store_goal_tool`: Save student goals
- `get_student_context_tool`: Retrieve relevant student context

## Usage Examples

### Basic Conversation

```
You: I'm interested in learning programming
Agent: I'd be happy to help you find programming courses! Let me search for some options...

[Agent searches courses and provides recommendations]

You: I prefer online courses
Agent: I'll remember that you prefer online courses. Let me find online programming options for you...
```

### Course Search

```
You: What data science courses are available?
Agent: [Searches and displays relevant data science courses with details]

You: Show me beginner-friendly options
Agent: [Filters results for beginner difficulty level]
```

### Memory and Context

```
You: I want to focus on machine learning
Agent: I'll remember that you're interested in machine learning. This will help me provide better recommendations in the future.

[Later in conversation or new session]
You: What courses should I take?
Agent: Based on your interest in machine learning and preference for online courses, here are my recommendations...
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL (default: redis://localhost:6379)
- `VECTOR_INDEX_NAME`: Name for course vector index (default: course_catalog)
- `MEMORY_INDEX_NAME`: Name for memory vector index (default: agent_memory)

### Customization

The agent is designed to be easily extensible:

1. **Add New Tools**: Extend the tool system in `agent.py`
2. **Modify Memory Logic**: Customize memory storage and retrieval in `memory.py`
3. **Extend Course Data**: Add new fields to course models in `models.py`
4. **Custom Recommendations**: Modify recommendation logic in `course_manager.py`

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Code Formatting

```bash

isort src/ scripts/
```

### Type Checking

    "# Context Compression Concepts: Managing Context Size\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Context Compression Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** As your agent conversations grow, context becomes huge and expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initial query: \"What courses should I take?\" (50 tokens)\n",
    "After 10 exchanges: 5,000 tokens\n",
    "After 50 exchanges: 25,000 tokens (exceeds most model limits!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- 💰 **Cost**: GPT-4 costs ~$0.03 per 1K tokens - 25K tokens = $0.75 per query!\n",
    "- ⏱️ **Latency**: Larger contexts = slower responses\n",
    "- 🚫 **Limits**: Most models have 4K-32K token limits\n",
    "- 🧠 **Quality**: Too much context can confuse the model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn simple, practical techniques to:\n",
    "1. **Measure context size** - Count tokens accurately\n",
    "2. **Compress intelligently** - Keep important info, remove fluff\n",
    "3. **Prioritize content** - Most relevant information first\n",
    "4. **Monitor effectiveness** - Track compression impact"

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn about long-term memory - persistent knowledge that survives across sessions. While working memory handles the current conversation, long-term memory stores important facts, preferences, and experiences that should be remembered indefinitely.\n",

    "\n",
    "- What long-term memory is and why it's essential\n",

    "### What is Long-term Memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memory is **persistent, cross-session knowledge** about users, preferences, and important facts. Unlike working memory (which is session-scoped), long-term memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Survives across sessions\n",
    "- ✅ Accessible from any conversation\n",
    "- ✅ Searchable via semantic vector search\n",
    "- ✅ Automatically deduplicated\n",
    "- ✅ Organized by user/namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working Memory vs. Long-term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "| Working Memory | Long-term Memory |\n",
    "|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Session-scoped** | **User-scoped** |\n",
    "| Current conversation | Important facts |\n",
    "| TTL-based (expires) | Persistent |\n",
    "| Full message history | Extracted knowledge |\n",
    "| Loaded/saved each turn | Searched when needed |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Types of Long-term Memories\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent Memory Server supports three types of long-term memories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Memory** - Facts and knowledge\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student prefers online courses\"\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student's major is Computer Science\"\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student wants to graduate in 2026\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Episodic Memory** - Events and experiences\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student enrolled in CS101 on 2024-09-15\"\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student asked about machine learning on 2024-09-20\"\n",
    "   - Example: \"Student completed Data Structures course\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Message Memory** - Important conversation snippets\n",
    "   - Example: Full conversation about career goals\n",
    "   - Example: Detailed discussion about course preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Right Memory Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding WHEN to use each memory type is crucial for effective memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Semantic Memory for: Facts and Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Timeless information (not tied to specific moment)\n",
    "- Likely to be referenced repeatedly\n",
    "- Can be stated independently of context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Good semantic memories\n",
    "\"Student prefers online courses\"\n",
    "\"Student's major is Computer Science\"  \n",
    "\"Student wants to graduate in 2026\"\n",
    "\"Student struggles with mathematics\"\n",
    "\"Student is interested in machine learning\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why semantic:**\n",
    "- Facts that don't change often\n",
    "- Will be useful across many sessions\n",
    "- Don't need temporal context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Episodic Memory for: Events and Timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Time-bound events\n",
    "- Sequence/timeline matters\n",
    "- Tracking progress or history\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Good episodic memories\n",
    "\"Student enrolled in CS101 on 2024-09-15\"\n",
    "\"Student completed CS101 on 2024-12-10\"\n",
    "\"Student started CS201 on 2024-01-15\"\n",
    "\"Student asked about career planning on 2024-10-20\"\n",
    "\"Student expressed concerns about workload on 2024-10-27\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why episodic:**\n",
    "- Events have specific dates\n",
    "- Order of events matters (CS101 before CS201)\n",
    "- Tracking student's journey over time\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Message Memory for: Context-Rich Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Full context is crucial\n",
    "- Tone/emotion matters\n",
    "- May need exact wording\n",
    "- Complex multi-part discussions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Good message memories\n",
    "\"Detailed career planning discussion: [full conversation]\"\n",
    "\"Professor's specific advice about research opportunities: [full message]\"\n",
    "\"Student's explanation of personal learning challenges: [full message]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why message:**\n",
    "- Summary would lose important nuance\n",
    "- Context around the words matters\n",
    "- Verbatim quote may be needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Use sparingly - message memories are token-expensive!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples: Right vs. Wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario 1: Student States Preference\n",
    "\n",
    "**User says:** \"I prefer online courses because I work during the day.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Message memory (too verbose)\n",
    "memory = \"Student said: 'I prefer online courses because I work during the day.'\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Right:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Semantic memories (extracted facts)\n",
    "memory1 = \"Student prefers online courses\"\n",
    "memory2 = \"Student works during the day\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Simple facts don't need full verbatim storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario 2: Course Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "**User says:** \"I just finished CS101 last week!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Semantic (loses temporal context)\n",
    "memory = \"Student completed CS101\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Right:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Episodic (preserves timeline)\n",
    "memory = \"Student completed CS101 on 2024-10-20\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Timeline matters for prerequisites and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario 3: Complex Career Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conversation:** 20-message discussion about career path, including professor's nuanced advice about research vs. industry, timing of applications, and specific companies to target.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Semantic (loses too much)\n",
    "memory = \"Student discussed career planning\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Right:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Message memory (preserves context)\n",
    "memory = [Full conversation thread with all nuance]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Details and context are critical, summary inadequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Reference Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Information Type | Memory Type | Example |\n",
    "|-----------------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| Preference | Semantic | \"Prefers morning classes\" |\n",
    "| Fact | Semantic | \"Major is Computer Science\" |\n",
    "| Goal | Semantic | \"Wants to graduate in 2026\" |\n",
    "| Event | Episodic | \"Enrolled in CS401 on 2024-09-15\" |\n",
    "| Timeline | Episodic | \"Completed CS101, then CS201\" |\n",
    "| Progress | Episodic | \"Asked about ML three times\" |\n",
    "| Complex discussion | Message | [Full career planning conversation] |\n",
    "| Nuanced advice | Message | [Professor's detailed guidance] |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Strategy: Prefer Semantic\n",
    "\n",
    "**When in doubt:**\n",
    "1. Can you extract a simple fact? → **Semantic**\n",
    "2. Is timing important? → **Episodic**\n",
    "3. Is full context crucial? → **Message** (use rarely)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most memories should be semantic** - they're compact, searchable, and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Semantic Search Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memories are stored with vector embeddings, enabling semantic search:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query: \"What does the student like?\"\n",
    "- Finds: \"Student prefers online courses\", \"Student enjoys programming\"\n",
    "- Even though exact words don't match!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Deduplication\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent Memory Server automatically prevents duplicate memories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hash-based**: Exact duplicates are rejected\n",
    "- **Semantic**: Similar memories are merged\n",
    "- Keeps memory storage efficient"

    "#### 1. Extract Before Expiration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working memory expires in 24 hours!**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Good: Extraction happens automatically\n",
    "# Agent Memory Server extracts facts from working memory\n",
    "# BEFORE it expires\n",
    "\n",
    "# ❌ Bad: Don't rely on working memory persisting\n",
    "# It will expire and take conversation context with it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Agent Memory Server handles extraction automatically** - this is why we use it!\n",

    "#### 2. Long-term Memories Are Permanent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unless you explicitly delete them:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Manual deletion (when needed)\n",
    "await memory_client.delete_memory(memory_id)\n",

    "# Or delete all memories for a user\n",
    "await memory_client.delete_all_user_memories(user_id)\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Practical Example: Multi-Day Conversation\n",

    "1. **Trust the extraction process**\n",
    "   - Agent Memory Server automatically extracts important facts\n",
    "   - Happens in background during conversation\n",
    "   - Important info moves to long-term before expiration\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Don't worry about working memory expiration**\n",
    "   - It's designed to expire\n",
    "   - Important facts are already extracted\n",
    "   - New sessions get clean slate\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Long-term memories are your persistent knowledge**\n",
    "   - Think of them as \"what the agent knows about the user\"\n",
    "   - Cross-session, cross-conversation\n",
    "   - The foundation of personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clean up when needed**\n",
    "   - Outdated preferences (user says \"I now prefer in-person classes\")\n",
    "   - Incorrect information (wrong major was recorded)\n",
    "   - User requests deletion\n",

    "\n",
    "Transform your RAG agent with **memory-enhanced context engineering**:\n",

    "### üéØ **Context Engineering Principles with Memory**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Reference Resolution**\n",
    "- **Working Memory** enables pronoun resolution (\"it\" ‚Üí specific course)\n",
    "- **Conversation History** provides context for temporal references (\"you mentioned\")\n",
    "- **Natural Language** patterns work without explicit clarification\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Personalized Context Assembly**\n",
    "- **Long-term Memory** provides user preferences and history\n",
    "- **Semantic Search** finds relevant memories automatically\n",
    "- **Context Efficiency** avoids repeating known information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Cross-Session Continuity**\n",
    "- **Persistent Knowledge** survives across conversations\n",
    "- **Learning Accumulation** builds better understanding over time\n",
    "- **Context Evolution** improves with each interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Production-Ready Architecture**\n",
    "- **Agent Memory Server** provides scalable memory management\n",
    "- **Automatic Extraction** learns from conversations\n",
    "- **Vector Search** enables semantic memory retrieval\n",
    "- **Deduplication** prevents redundant memory storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ **Memory-Enhanced Context Engineering Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Layer Your Context**:\n",
    "   - Base: Student profile\n",
    "   - Personalization: Long-term memories\n",
    "   - Domain: Relevant courses/content\n",
    "   - Conversation: Working memory\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enable Reference Resolution**:\n",
    "   - Store conversation history in working memory\n",
    "   - Provide recent messages for pronoun resolution\n",
    "   - Use temporal context for \"you mentioned\" references\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Leverage Semantic Search**:\n",
    "   - Search long-term memory with user queries\n",
    "   - Include relevant memories in context\n",
    "   - Let the system find connections automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize Context Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - Avoid repeating information stored in memory\n",

    "- **Minimal:** Listed all courses but repeated RU101 (which Sarah already finished)\n",

    "**1. System Context Alone = Generic Bot**\n",
    "- Must ask follow-up questions\n",
    "- Can't personalize\n",

    "| **With Retrieval** | Complex decisions, detailed planning | \"Plan my learning path for the year\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Means for Production\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Right Context Strategy Depends On:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Do you have user history?**\n",
    "   - Yes → Include user context\n",
    "   - No → Use minimal, ask questions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Is the query complex?**\n",
    "   - Yes → Retrieve specific details\n",
    "   - No → User context might be enough\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are you near token limits?**\n",
    "   - Yes → Switch to minimal or summarize\n",
    "   - No → Use rich context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Rule:** Start with rich context (all four types). Only reduce when you hit token limits or lack data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Items\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this test, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always include user context** when available (massive quality improvement, low token cost)\n",
    "2. **Retrieve context dynamically** based on what the query asks about (don't retrieve RU201 details for every question)\n",
    "3. **Monitor token usage** - several responses were cut off at 150 tokens\n",
    "4. **Test with your own use case** - Run this experiment with your domain and queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom Line:** More relevant context = better responses. The challenge is determining what's \"relevant\" and managing token budgets."

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed Chapter 1: Foundations of Context Engineering. Let's recap your journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Notebook 01: Why Context Engineering Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "You discovered the fundamental problem that context engineering solves:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Problem:**\n",
    "- AI agents without context are like doctors without medical records - they can't remember, personalize, or maintain coherent interactions\n",
    "- This leads to frustrated users, operational inefficiency, and limited AI capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Impact:**\n",
    "- You saw the dramatic difference between context-less and context-aware AI through the university advisor example\n",
    "- Without context: repetitive, generic, frustrating interactions\n",
    "- With context: personalized, coherent, valuable assistance\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Four Context Types:**\n",
    "You learned the foundational framework:\n",
    "1. **System Context** - \"What am I?\" (Role, rules, domain knowledge)\n",
    "2. **User Context** - \"Who are you?\" (Profile, preferences, history)\n",
    "3. **Conversation Context** - \"What have we discussed?\" (Dialogue flow)\n",
    "4. **Retrieved Context** - \"What information is relevant?\" (On-demand data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Fundamental Constraint:**\n",
    "- Every AI model has a context window limit (e.g., 128K tokens)\n",
    "- Every token spent on one type of context is unavailable for another\n",
    "- Context engineering is optimization within constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Importance:**\n",
    "- Customer support, healthcare, sales, research - all require proper context management\n",
    "- Poor context management has measurable business impact: 40-60% abandonment rates, 3-5x more interactions needed, high escalation rates\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Notebook 02: How to Implement Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "You mastered the practical implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hands-On Skills Acquired:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Building System Context**\n",
    "   - How to define AI role and identity\n",
    "   - Structuring domain knowledge effectively\n",
    "   - Writing clear behavioral guidelines\n",
    "   - Understanding static vs. dynamic information\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating User Context**\n",
    "   - Storing user profiles as structured data\n",

    "**Integration Mastery:**\n",
    "- You learned how to combine all four context types into a single LLM call\n",
    "- You saw the complete message array structure that makes intelligent responses possible\n",
    "- You understood how each context type contributes to the final response quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic Thinking:**\n",
    "You explored three context management strategies:\n",
    "- **Minimal Context** - For new users with no history\n",
    "- **Rich Context** - For returning users with established profiles\n",
    "- **Optimized Context** - For long conversations near token limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "1. Start simple, add complexity gradually\n",
    "2. Measure token usage continuously\n",
    "3. Optimize for relevance, not completeness\n",
    "4. Use clear, structured formatting\n",
    "5. Test and iterate based on results\n",

    "# What is Context Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Engineering** is the discipline of designing, implementing, and optimizing context management systems for AI agents and applications. It's the practice of ensuring that AI systems have the right information, at the right time, in the right format to make intelligent decisions and provide relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of context engineering as the \"memory and awareness system\" for AI agents - it's what allows them to:\n",
    "- Remember past conversations and experiences\n",
    "- Understand their role and capabilities\n",
    "- Access relevant information from large knowledge bases\n",
    "- Maintain coherent, personalized interactions over time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Context Engineering Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Without proper context engineering, AI agents are like people with severe amnesia - they can't remember what happened five minutes ago, don't know who they're talking to, and can't learn from experience. This leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poor User Experience**\n",
    "- Repetitive conversations\n",
    "- Lack of personalization\n",
    "- Inconsistent responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inefficient Operations**\n",
    "- Redundant processing\n",
    "- Inability to build on previous work\n",
    "- Lost context between sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limited Capabilities**\n",
    "- Can't handle complex, multi-step tasks\n",
    "- No learning or adaptation\n",
    "- Poor integration with existing systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components of Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Context engineering involves several key components working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. System Context\n",
    "What the AI should know about itself and its environment:\n",
    "- Role and responsibilities\n",
    "- Available tools and capabilities\n",
    "- Operating constraints and guidelines\n",
    "- Domain-specific knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Memory Management\n",
    "How information is stored, retrieved, and maintained:\n",
    "- **Working memory**: Persistent storage focused on the current task, including conversation context and task-related data\n",
    "- **Long-term memory**: Knowledge learned across sessions, such as user preferences and important facts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Context Retrieval\n",
    "How relevant information is found and surfaced:\n",
    "- Semantic search and similarity matching\n",
    "- Relevance ranking and filtering\n",
    "- Context window management\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Context Integration\n",
    "How different types of context are combined:\n",
    "- Merging multiple information sources\n",
    "- Resolving conflicts and inconsistencies\n",
    "- Prioritizing information by importance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Example: University Class Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore context engineering through a practical example - a university class recommendation agent. This agent helps students find courses, plan their academic journey, and provides personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Without Context Engineering\n",
    "```\n",
    "Student: \"I'm interested in programming courses\"\n",
    "Agent: \"Here are all programming courses: CS101, CS201, CS301...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Student: \"I prefer online courses\"\n",
    "Agent: \"Here are all programming courses: CS101, CS201, CS301...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Student: \"What about my major requirements?\"\n",
    "Agent: \"I don't know your major. Here are all programming courses...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Context Engineering\n",
    "```\n",
    "Student: \"I'm interested in programming courses\"\n",
    "Agent: \"Great! I can help you find programming courses. Let me search our catalog...\n",
    "        Based on your Computer Science major and beginner level, I recommend:\n",
    "        - CS101: Intro to Programming (online, matches your preference)\n",
    "        - CS102: Data Structures (hybrid option available)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Student: \"Tell me more about CS101\"\n",
    "Agent: \"CS101 is perfect for you! It's:\n",
    "        - Online format (your preference)\n",
    "        - Beginner-friendly\n",
    "        - Required for your CS major\n",
    "        - No prerequisites needed\n",
    "        - Taught by Prof. Smith (highly rated)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we explore context engineering in action, let's set up our environment with the necessary dependencies and connections."

    "\n",
    "From this introduction to context engineering, we can see several important principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Context is Multi-Dimensional\n",
    "- **System context**: What the AI knows about itself\n",
    "- **User context**: What the AI knows about the user\n",
    "- **Domain context**: What the AI knows about the subject matter\n",
    "- **Conversation context**: What has been discussed recently\n",
    "- **Historical context**: What has been learned over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these sources are static, updated only when the agent's code changes, while others may be retrieved dynamically from external sources, such as via APIs or vector search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Memory is Essential\n",
    "- **Working memory**: Maintains conversation flow and task-related context\n",
    "- **Long-term memory**: Enables learning and personalization across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Context Must Be Actionable\n",
    "- Information is only valuable if it can improve responses\n",
    "- Context should be prioritized by relevance and importance\n",
    "- The system must be able to integrate multiple context sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Context Engineering is Iterative\n",
    "- Systems improve as they gather more context\n",
    "- Context quality affects response quality\n",
    "- Feedback loops help refine context management"

    "- **Real-time constraints:** Must retrieve relevant context in milliseconds\n",
    "- **Multi-modal:** Text, images, structured data, API responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Relevance Determination\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic understanding:** \"ML courses\" and \"machine learning classes\" are the same\n",
    "- **Context dependency:** Relevance changes based on user background and goals\n",
    "- **Implicit needs:** User asks X but really needs Y\n",
    "- **Conflicting signals:** Multiple pieces of context suggest different actions\n",

    "### 3. Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What to remember:** Important facts vs. casual remarks\n",
    "- **How long to remember:** Session vs. long-term memory\n",

    "- **How to summarize:** Compress long conversations without losing meaning\n",

    "### 4. Integration Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple data sources:** CRM, databases, APIs, documents\n",
    "- **Different formats:** JSON, text, tables, graphs\n",
    "- **Access control:** Privacy, permissions, data sovereignty\n",
    "- **Latency requirements:** Fast retrieval vs. comprehensive search\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Cost and Performance\n",

    "- **Token costs:** More context = higher API costs\n",

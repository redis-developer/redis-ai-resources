    "There are different ways to calculate the similarity between sets of text. Redis supports several, such as `BM25`, `TFIDF`, `DISMAX`, and others. The default is `BM25STD` and is easy to configure with the `text_scorer` parameter. Just like changing you embedding model can change your vector similarity scores, changing your text similarity measure can change your text scores.\n",

    "Because hybrid queries are performing a weighted average of text similarity and vector similarity you also control the relative balance of these scores with the `alpha` parameter.\n",

It was a full hour. Closing is 9:00. Why mention? I think we woke the hostess when we walked in the door. The restaurant is quite large and patrons were clustered in a small portion of the restaurant. Makes sense to me. Chairs were turned upside down in other sections - just a bit off putting. Inside the setting was dark and rustic. I'd say it was a well worn setting. Table chairs were odd and must have been a later addition as their height was lower than expected (first time I've noticed that). The menu had the expected selection of standard Italian fare. Four of us looking for something a little lighter so we ordered a salad - nicely sized and fresh, calamari - well done and plentiful, 2 calzones - huge for one person, and a pizza. The pizza was awesome! Super thin crust with an excellent cheese and a nice sauce to cheese ratio. The crust was crisp, ever so charred, really good. A bit far for us for takeout pizza but it might be worth it. Waitstaff was a mixed bag. Our waiter was friendly and helpful, though sort of disappeared at times. Others were slothing around and seemingly ready to end their evenings. Overall okay experience. Come for the pizza. We will probably want to be back to explore the menu.

We shared everything (a total of about eight dishes) and we liked everything - but some were better than others. We especially liked the trout, the smoked potatoes, the beets and the salad. If you want a restaurant where you don\\'t have to think about the food, this is not for you. But we liked the creativity and playfulness of the approach. Service was good, friendly but not obtrusive.\\\\n\\\\nNice experience Was unable to book a favorite restaurant and chose this place based on its ratings. Good choice. Lively bar. Nice menu with a variety of offerings. We enjoyed several appetizers and entrees. Good wine list. Great service. The four of us had a good dining experience and would certainly return on another visit to San Francisco.\\\\n\\\\nhealthy food & diverse menu This is a great place to eat if you are looking for good flavorful food, The menu is well balanced nutritionally. The service is excellent but this place is very expensive. I would have given 5 stars but we got a hair in are food and we were still charged for the dish The decor is really cool and the atmosphere is good.\\\\n\\\\nFun place, tasty meal My sister and I ate here during a recent trip to the San Francisco area for a job interview. I liked almost everything about this restaurant. The décor was techno-edgy but comfortable. It was packed and a little noisy but we could hear each other as we were seated at a banquette along one wall. We had the lobster rolls—a salad of delicious lobster meat plus vegetables in a small roll, served with very good cole slaw and—of all things—hush puppies. Very tasty, non-greasy hush-puppies. The lobster roll was one of the more gently-priced items on the menu. Other items looked tempting, but too expensive for this visit. Friendly, prompt, efficient service. Nice experience.\\\\n\\\\nGood and different I liked the way the restaurant looked, the food was good and different.To me, foreigner, this is very \\'San Francisco\\'.Organic, trendy, laidback, good...Not overly priced either.Good place!\\\\n\\\\nFirst time I have ever been compelled to write a bad review Appetizers clearly microwaved; the plate was hot with microwaved burnt food on it and all were cold in the middle. Service awful. Brought limited bread for ten of us and the wait was really long. Brought some food out which became cold while we waited for the others in our party to get their meal. Stay away from the steaks; bad cuts and way over cooked. Were served on a hot sizzling platter spraying grease everywhere. Very chewy. Brussel sprouts hard seemingly uncooked with soggy garlic wedges. Entrees cold in the middle and side pastas with marinara sauce all cold when served. Brown tinted water served to one of us and waiter absolutely was awful. Appeared happy but very annoyed if we asked for anything and hard to find. Will never ever go there. I hope the owner reads this...was there a year ago and it was excellent. Today I warn all to stay away.\\\\n\\\\nGreat Italian Food, great drink menu Group of 10 went for lunch on a Saturday.We were seated right away and our waitress was tentative in getting our drinks ,answering our questions, and checking on us all. Everyone\\'s food was great. They have options for most items to be lunch portion for the whole menu, the interior and exterior were decorated well with Italian rustic theme, the entire place was clean. Everything was priced well and had something everyone could enjoy.\\\\n\\\\nGreat place for a healthy dinner We had dinner here and really appreciated the fact that the menu is so healthy - full of vegetable based dishes. It is sometimes difficult to eat healthy food when you travel. Service is good - staff friendly and efficient. Nice ambience and good little wine list. Great bread to start and then we shared a selection of dishes including the charred trout with mustard greens, kale with sunflower tahini and yoghurt, brussels sprouts with tonnato sauce and dried tuna. We would certainly go back if we lived in San Francisco.\\\\n\\\\nGreat Pizza, good food - ok exoerience I will temper this review with a note that we arrived an hour before closing on a weeknight. It was a full hour. Closing is 9:00. Why mention? I think we woke the hostess when we walked in the door. The restaurant is quite large and patrons were clustered in a small portion of the restaurant. Makes sense to me. Chairs were turned upside down in other sections - just a bit off putting. Inside the setting was dark and rustic. I\\'d say it was a well worn setting. Table chairs were odd and must have been a later addition as their height was lower than expected (first time I\\'ve noticed that). The menu had the expected selection of standard Italian fare. Four of us looking for something a little lighter so we ordered a salad - nicely sized and fresh, calamari - well done and plentiful, 2 calzones - huge for one person, and a pizza. The pizza was awesome! Super thin crust with an excellent cheese and a nice sauce to cheese ratio. The crust was crisp, ever so charred, really good. A bit far for us for takeout pizza but it might be worth it. Waitstaff was a mixed bag. Our waiter was friendly and helpful, though sort of disappeared at times.

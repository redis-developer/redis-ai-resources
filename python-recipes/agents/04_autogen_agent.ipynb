No major issue but it would have been nice to see at the very least Californian produce. I\\'m being fussy. My meal was tasty and I enjoyed the crab parfait very much although hoped it would have been in pâté style rather than in the ice cream sundae style of \\'parfait\\'. My special dish of lobster risotto was excellent - creamy and on the over side of al dente. The view is to die for and the staff are very friendly and efficient.

And each time, it is consistently one of the most tragic, horrendous service experiences and we vow to never go back. We dine regularly enough that the manager must recognize us. For the love of everything holy, her staff manages to. The Manager, as the first experience in the restaurant, is shameful and a true detriment to the business. She is rude and truly doesn't seem to care if she loses customers, in fact, unless you're a regular or have a pre-existing relationship with her, she actually exerts effort to turn customers off/away.

As I write this, I realize that sounds ridiculous and perhaps even more so, we actually try to convince ourselves each time that it's going to be different. And each time, it is consistently one of the most tragic, horrendous service experiences and we vow to never go back. We dine regularly enough that the manager must recognize us. For the love of everything holy, her staff manages to. The Manager, as the first experience in the restaurant, is shameful and a true detriment to the business. She is rude and truly doesn't seem to care if she loses customers, in fact, unless you're a regular or have a pre-existing relationship with her, she actually exerts effort to turn customers off/away. Much of the staff has no pep in their step, really excellent at looking busy. I feel badly for those who really hustle and at least act like they care about the customer... I always find myself wishing I had one of those servers. Plan on having a 45 minute to 1 hour wait for the entrees, and to inquire at least twice about the food and each time your water needs a refill. My husband and I hate that we enjoy the food and that the kids eat without complaint (if you're wondering, the only reason why my 7 yr old and 3 yr old are not starving deranged lunatics is because we always order their food as soon as we sit down - as self preservation. There's a tip, I guess. Happy, fed children make for happy parents. There's no room for 4 starving people who, due to poor service and empty bellies become crankier by the moment). After tonight though, we are feeling more resolute to break this nasty cycle...

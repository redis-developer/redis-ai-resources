Agentic systems require both **short-term** and **long-term** memory in order to complete tasks in a personalized and resilient manner. Memory is all about state management and [**Redis**](https://redis.io/try-free/) is the well-known in-memory database for exaclty this kind of use case today in production systems.\n",

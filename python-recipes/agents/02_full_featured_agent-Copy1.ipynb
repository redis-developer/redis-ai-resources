    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the workshop is to create an agent workflow that can handle five Oregon Trail-themed scenarios, mimicking situations that often arise when implementing agent workflows in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario 1 - name of the wagon leader\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning goal:** Test basic LangGraph setup and execution. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** `What is the first name of the wagon leader?` <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** `Art` <br>\n",
    "**Type:** `free-form` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario 2 - restocking tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning goal:** Agent interaction with custom defined tool and **structured output** for multiple choice questions. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** `In order to survive the trail ahead, you'll need to have a restocking strategy for when you need to get more supplies or risk starving. If it takes you an estimated 3 days to restock your food and you plan to start with 200lbs of food, budget 10lbs/day to eat, and keep a safety stock of at least 50lbs of back up... at what point should you restock?` <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** `D` <br>\n",
    "**Options:** `[\"A: 100lbs\", \"B: 20lbs\", \"C: 5lbs\", \"D: 80lbs\"]` <br>\n",
    "**Type:** `multi-choice` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario 3 - retrieval tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning goal:** Agent implements Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** `You’ve encountered a dense forest near the Blue Mountains, and your party is unsure how to proceed. There is a fork in the road, and you must choose a path. Which way will you go?` <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** `B` <br>\n",
    "**Options:** `[\"A: take the northern trail\", \"B: take the southern trail\", \"C: turn around\", \"D: go fishing\"]` <br>\n",
    "**Type:** `multi-choice` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario 4 - semantic cache\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning goal:** Implement semantic cache that bypasses expensive agent workflow for known answer. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** `There's a deer. You're hungry. You know what you have to do...` <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** `bang` <br>\n",
    "**Type:** `free-form` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario 5 - allow/block list with router\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning goal:** Implement semantic router that blocks requests for non-related topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** `Tell me about the S&P 500?` <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** `you shall not pass` <br>\n",
    "**Type:** `free-form` <br>\n",

    "In the end, we are building a workflow like the following:\n",

    "![diagram](../../assets/full_featured_agent.png)\n",

    "As a reminder for more detail see: [Redis Developer Oregon Trail Agent Workshop](https://github.com/redis-developer/oregon-trail-agent-workshop).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Defining the agent with LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are functions that the central LLM powered \"agent\" can determine to invoke depending on the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restock tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The first tool we will define implements the restocking formula. LLMs are designed to predict text responses, not to perform deterministic math. In this case, the agent will act as a parser, extracting the necessary information from the human query and calling the tool with the appropriate schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of `LangGraph` is that the schema for the tool can be defined as a `pydantic` model. Note: It is also essential to include a well-written `doc_string` with the tool function so the agent can determine the appropriate situation to use the tool."

    "2. **Invoke Tools**: If it decides to invoke the tools, the response from the tool is appended as a message to the state and passed back to the agent.  \n",
    "3. **Determine Next Step**: If tools have already been called or are deemed unnecessary, the graph moves to the `structure_response` node.  \n",
    "4. **Handle Multiple-Choice Questions**: If the question is identified as a **multiple-choice question** within the `structure_response` node, a model is invoked to ensure the response is returned as a literal `A, B, C, or D`, as expected by the game. Otherwise, it simply proceeds forward.  "

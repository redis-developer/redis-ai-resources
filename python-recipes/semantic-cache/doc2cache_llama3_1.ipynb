      "A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\n",

      "timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n",
      "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\n",

    "Overall our RAG app showed pretty good performance. All values indicated above 0.6, which from anecdotal experience, is a reasonable lower-bound for performance however obviously higher values are more ideal. It is worth noting that generation metrics can be a bit more hazy in terms of ideal ranges since the LLM evaluation cannot yet capture the way a response feels to a user. For these metrics it's important to make sure they are not severely low however blind optimization to the top can result in a very uncreative chat experience which may or may not be ideal for the intended use case.\n",

What are short-term investments and how are they classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets?,"[""CASH AND EQUIVALENTS Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, with maturities three months or less at the date of purchase.\n\n2023 FORM 10-K 62\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS\n\nShort-term investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities over three months at the date of purchase. At May 31, 2023 and 2022, Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), unless unrealized losses are determined to be unrecoverable. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company's Short-term investments.\n\nALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts due from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and industry trends to determine the amount of the allowance. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $35 million and $34 million as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nINVENTORY VALUATION""]","Short-term investments are highly liquid investments with maturities over three months at the date of purchase.

What are some of the risks and uncertainties associated with NIKE Direct operations?,"['Our NIKE Direct operations, including our retail stores and digital platforms, have required and will continue to require significant investment. Our NIKE Direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms. Because of their unique design and technological elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and- mortar retail, or the closure, temporary or otherwise, or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.\n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; and theft.']","Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties.

What is NIKE's policy regarding securities analysts and their reports?,"[""Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nThe risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKE's business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

What risk does the Company face with hedging instruments and how is it managed?,"[""NET INVESTMENT HEDGES The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2023.\n\nUNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2023.\n\nCREDIT RISK\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.""]","The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments.

What external factors pose risks to NIKE Direct operations?,"['Our NIKE Direct operations, including our retail stores and digital platforms, have required and will continue to require significant investment. Our NIKE Direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms. Because of their unique design and technological elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and- mortar retail, or the closure, temporary or otherwise, or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.\n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; and theft.']","Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties.

"What is the role of GAAP in financial reporting, as evaluated by management and an independent accounting firm?","['Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) - 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2023.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, as stated in their report herein.', ""The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

How does the Company categorize financial assets and liabilities based on fair value measurements and what determines their classification?,"[""Lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced by the amount of lease incentives. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the lease and options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. The Company does not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain lease agreements include variable lease payments, which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or adjust periodically for inflation as a result of changes in a published index, primarily the Consumer Price Index, and are expensed as incurred.\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, equity securities and available-for-sale debt securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used, as follows:\n\n2023 FORM 10-K 64\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or\n\nliabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\n\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

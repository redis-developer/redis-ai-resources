Analysts' estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities.

1,How do currency exchange rates impact the financial results of the company?," Currency exchange rates can significantly impact the company's financial results, as the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars can result in either a benefit or a detriment to the company's revenues and earnings. Fluctuations in exchange rates can also increase costs and decrease margins, resulting in lower revenues and profits. The company hedges certain foreign currency exposures to minimize the impact of these fluctuations, but they cannot completely eliminate the effects. ","[""Economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global economic environment, including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates, could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.\n\nA majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Central banks may deploy various strategies to combat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which may impact our borrowing costs. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.""
 'Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries\' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders\' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $2,859 million, $295 million and a benefit of approximately $893 million for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $824 million, $87 million and a benefit of approximately $260 million for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nMANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP""). We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.'
 ""As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse.

2,Why are cost-effective investments considered essential for business growth and profitability?," Cost-effective investments are considered essential for business growth and profitability because they allow companies to allocate resources efficiently and maximize their returns. By making smart and strategic investments, businesses can improve their operations, expand their market share, and increase their profits. This can also lead to increased shareholder value and attract potential investors. Additionally, cost-effective investments can help companies stay competitive in their industry and adapt to changing market conditions.

3,What changes were made to the U.S. corporate income tax system by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022?," The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 made significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including introducing new profit allocation and nexus rules and implementing a global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% as proposed by the OECD and G20 Inclusive Framework.","['Proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on global earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the ""Inclusive Framework"") has put forth two proposals—Pillar One and Pillar Two—that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and ensure a minimal level of taxation, respectively. On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the Inclusive Framework\'s global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the Inclusive Framework\'s proposals. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will be enacted into law, these changes, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows.\n\nPortions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are under a tax holiday. We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters. Tax holidays and rulings can expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate. For example, in January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods, and the Company\'s income taxes related to prior periods in the Netherlands could increase.'

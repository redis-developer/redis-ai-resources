The company manufactures and sells most products outside the United States, conducting transactions in various currencies, exposing it to the volatility of global economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates. Central banks may raise interest rates to combat inflation, affecting the company's borrowing costs. Currency exchange rate fluctuations impact the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to other currencies, affecting the company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could disrupt the business of independent manufacturers producing the company's products by increasing raw material costs and financing difficulties.

The significant accounting policies and methods used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note 1 of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are those assumptions and judgments with the greatest potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has reviewed and discussed critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Actual results could differ from estimates used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements due to inherent uncertainties. There are no known events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported within the critical accounting estimates. Sales-related reserves include provisions for anticipated sales returns, post-invoice sales discounts, contractual return rights, discretionary authorized returns, contractual programs, and discretionary discounts.", "Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts, and claims are based on historical rates. Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts, and claims are based on specific identification of outstanding returns from customers. Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts, and claims are based on specific identification of outstanding discounts and claims. Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts, and claims are based on estimated returns, discounts, and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts, and claims in any future period are uncertain and may differ from recorded estimates. Significantly different actual or expected future returns, discounts, or claims from reserves established could result in a reduction or increase to net revenues. A reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period of determination. Refer to Note 14 \u2014 Revenues in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Ongoing estimates are made regarding the net realizable value of inventories based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If the net realizable value of inventory is less than the recorded cost, a reserve equal to the difference is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. Changes in market conditions leading to reductions in the estimated net realizable value result in an increase in the reserve. Changes in market conditions leading to reductions in the estimated net realizable value may result in increasing the reserve in the period of determination. Additional information on inventory reserves can be found in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The company engages in hedge accounting for derivatives.", "The company uses derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency and interest rate transactions, as well as non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of contracts hedging forecasted cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) if criteria for hedge accounting are met. Gains and losses on hedge derivatives are usually transferred from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Net income after the derivative matures. One criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of derivative contracts should not exceed the designated amount for anticipated transactions. Fluctuations in estimated versus actual transactions may occur over time. If anticipated or actual transactions decrease below hedged levels, or if a forecasted transaction is unlikely to occur within the specified time frame, the fair value of the over-hedged portion is reclassified. Reclassification to Other (income) expense, net happens in the quarter of the decrease. In some cases, the additional time period for reclassification may exceed two months due to uncontrollable circumstances related to the forecasted transaction. Refer to Note 12 \u2014 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this topic.", "The company is subject to taxation in the United States, various state jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions. Determining the provision for income taxes involves significant judgment, use of estimates, and interpretation of complex tax laws. The company estimates its effective tax rate for the full fiscal year on an interim basis. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to year-to-date Income before income taxes, excluding infrequently occurring items, to calculate the year-to-date Income tax expense. Income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period of occurrence. Throughout the fiscal year, the company refines its tax rate estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction. Changes in the expected effective tax rate lead to adjustments in the income tax provision during the quarter of estimation change. On a quarterly basis, the company assesses the probability of effectively sustaining a tax position and appropriateness of recognized amounts for uncertain tax positions. Changes in assessment may result in recognizing a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in Income tax expense. For more information on income taxes, refer to Note 7 \u2014 Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "In the normal course of business, the company faces legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations related to various aspects including contractual relationships, product liability, antitrust, tax, intellectual property, and others. Contingent liabilities are recorded when a loss is likely and its amount can be reasonably estimated. Assessing the probability of loss and estimating such losses involves analyzing multiple factors and making judgments about potential actions of third parties and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best available information, but actual losses in the future are uncertain. If adjustments to estimated future losses exceed recorded liabilities, additional charges are reported. In addition to recording contingent liabilities for probable losses, the company discloses liabilities where there is a reasonable chance that the actual loss might significantly exceed the recorded amount.

The foreign exchange risk management program aims to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the company's financial results. Forward and option contracts are used to hedge anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. Hedging delays the impact of exchange rate movements on the company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Hedging decisions are guided by the company's policies, nature of exposure, and prevailing market conditions. The majority of derivatives outstanding are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges for various currency pairs. The company manages exposure to interest rate changes to limit the impact on earnings and cash flows. A mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt with varying maturities is maintained to manage interest rate exposure. Market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk are used to monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and related derivatives. Market-sensitive instruments include foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany loans in non-functional currencies, and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.", "The company uses VaR to monitor foreign exchange risk of foreign currency forward and option derivative instruments. VaR determines maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of these financial instruments. VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used for VaR computation. Computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates using a 'variance/co-variance' technique. Interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. Value of foreign currency options does not change one-to-one with underlying currency rate changes. Potential loss in option value is adjusted for estimated sensitivity to changes in currency rate ('delta' and 'gamma'). Calculation reflects impact of currency rate fluctuations on derivative instruments only, excluding non-functional currency transactions. VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not represent actual losses or consider potential favorable changes in market rates. VaR does not capture the full extent of possible losses; actual gains and losses will differ due to various market factors.", "The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments using the VaR model was $111 million and $99 million as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year due to an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2023. A hypothetical loss in the fair value of derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $289 million and $170 million during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation. Interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with non-functional currency intercompany loans are considered immaterial to the consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Details of third-party debt are provided in a table showing principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

If carrying value is not recoverable, the Company estimates fair value using appropriate methods such as discounted cash flows. Impairment is measured as the difference between carrying amount and estimated fair value for the asset group. The Company conducts annual impairment tests on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill is allocated across operating segments for impairment testing. Qualitative factors are initially considered to assess whether fair value is likely less than carrying amount for goodwill and intangible assets. If it's determined that fair value exceeds carrying amount, no impairment test is necessary. Tests are conducted in the fourth quarter or when events indicate a potential reduction in fair value.", "If an impairment test is needed, the Company will estimate the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset.

NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. The NTC sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign currency exposure for NTC when selling to entities with different functional currency. Some NIKE entities purchase products directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars, leading to foreign currency exposure for entities with functional currency other than U.S. Dollar.

Credit risk is limited to unrealized gains in contracts if any counterparties fail to perform as contracted. The Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored to manage this risk.", "The Company's derivative contracts have credit risk-related contingent features to protect against counterparties' credit deterioration and ability to settle contracts. Bilateral credit-related features may require posting collateral over $50 million if fair value exceeds $50 million for outstanding derivatives.

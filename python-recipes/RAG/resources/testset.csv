What potential consequences could securities class action litigation have on a company's operations and reputation?,"[""Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts' opinions of our future performance, which may, in part, be based upon any guidance we have provided. Analysts' estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in reputational damage, substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources needed to successfully run our business.\n\n2023 FORM 10-K 23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nITEM 1B.

How do currency exchange rates impact the financial results of the company?,"[""Economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global economic environment, including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates, could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.\n\nA majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Central banks may deploy various strategies to combat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which may impact our borrowing costs. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.""]",Currency exchange rate fluctuations could disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance.

Why are cost-effective investments considered essential for business growth and profitability?,"['From time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses or capabilities, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our NIKE Direct operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. See also ""Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.""\n\nThe sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal shareholder could depress the market price of our common stock.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned approximately 77% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2023, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, Swoosh, LLC\'s commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. Mr. Knight does not have voting rights with respect to Swoosh, LLC, although Travis Knight, his son and a NIKE director, has a significant role in the management of the Class A Common Stock owned by Swoosh, LLC.\n\nChanges in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.']","Cost-effective investments are considered essential for business growth and profitability because they contribute to the development of new businesses, expansion of existing businesses, and the improvement of product offerings and manufacturing innovation.

What changes were made to the U.S. corporate income tax system by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022?,"['FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2022\n\nOther (income) expense, net increased from $181 million of other income, net in fiscal 2022 to $280 million in the current fiscal year, primarily due to a net favorable change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges, and the one-time charge related to the deconsolidation of our Russian operations recognized in the prior year.

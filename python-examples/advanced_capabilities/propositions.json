Forward-looking statements may include predictions, forecasts, expectations, and implications about future results, performance, or achievements. These statements incorporate estimates, projections, and assumptions about NIKE's business plans, objectives, and financial results. Risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements can lead to actual results differing from what is predicted.", "Fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including changes in shipment timing, order mix, discounts, cancellations, and returns may not reflect future revenues. NIKE's ability to sustain, manage, and forecast growth and inventories is crucial. Size, timing, and mix of purchases of NIKE's products are significant factors. Increases in the cost of materials, labor, and energy for manufacturing impact operations. Securing and protecting trademarks, patents, and intellectual property is essential. Product performance, quality, and customer service are key considerations. Maintaining NIKE's reputation and brand image is vital, especially with social media presence. Dependence on distributors, licensees, and potential loss of significant customers or suppliers poses risks. Risks associated with international operations include exchange rate fluctuations, political instability, and terrorism. Adapting to new laws, regulations, tariffs, and policy changes is necessary for compliance. Legal issues such as litigation, regulatory proceedings, and sanctions can impact NIKE. Attracting and retaining qualified employees is critical for sustainable growth. Investment decisions and business divestments can have significant effects on NIKE. Health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic present operational challenges. Effects of climate change, extreme weather, and natural disasters need to be considered.", "NIKE communicates with securities analysts but does not disclose material non-public or confidential commercial information to them. Shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement issued by securities analysts. NIKE does not confirm financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Reports containing projections, forecasts, or opinions from securities analysts are not NIKE's responsibility. The risks mentioned in this section are not exhaustive. Other parts of the Annual Report may include factors that could negatively impact NIKE's business and financial performance. NIKE operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks may arise over time that management cannot predict or evaluate completely. Investors should not overly rely on forward-looking statements as a guarantee of actual results. Global economic conditions may significantly affect NIKE's business, operating results, and financial condition. Factors such as consumer discretionary spending can impact NIKE's sales. Economic downturns can lead to reduced demand, increased inventories, and other adverse effects on NIKE's business. There is a risk that NIKE may face challenges in accessing financing in credit and capital markets at reasonable rates.", "Transactions are conducted in various currencies, exposing the company to foreign exchange rate fluctuations relative to the U.S. Dollar. Volatility in markets and foreign exchange rates can significantly impact the company's operating results and financial condition. Volatility in commodity prices and raw materials, like cotton or petroleum derivatives, can adversely affect costs, gross margins, and profitability. Supply chain issues due to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts may impact the availability, pricing, and timing of obtaining commodities and raw materials. Retailers facing revenue decline or difficulty obtaining financing may reduce orders, resulting in late payments, increased accounts receivable, and potentially higher bad debt expense for the company. Financial difficulties or insolvency of retailers could negatively affect the sale of the company's products to consumers. Difficulty in financing for contract manufacturers or other supply chain participants may lead to delays or non-delivery of the company's products. The company's products, services, and experiences encounter fierce competition.", "NIKE is a consumer products company. The relative popularity of sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for NIKE's products, services, and experiences. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is highly competitive in the United States and worldwide. NIKE competes internationally with numerous athletic and leisure footwear companies, apparel companies, and sports equipment companies. NIKE also competes for production capacity with other companies for contract manufacturers that produce their products. NIKE and their contract manufacturers compete with other companies and industries for raw materials used in their products. NIKE Direct operations, through digital commerce operations and retail stores, compete with multi-brand retailers and digital commerce platforms. NIKE competes with other companies in offering digital services and experiences to consumers, including fitness and activity apps, sport and wellness content, and features that enhance the consumer experience. Product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures, pricing, production costs, customer service, digital commerce platforms, and social media presence are areas of intense competition for NIKE. Rapid changes in technology, reduced barriers to entry for new footwear and apparel companies, and changing consumer preferences pose significant risk factors to NIKE's operations. Competition in retail, shifts in consumer shopping behavior, and the growth of digital commerce present risks for both NIKE Direct and wholesale operations. Failure to anticipate and respond to competitors may lead to cost increases, declining product demand, or the need to reduce product prices for NIKE.", "Economic factors beyond the Company's control and changes in the global economic environment may lead to lower revenues, higher costs, and decreased margins and earnings. Majority of the Company's products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. The Company conducts purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, exposing it to volatility in global economic conditions such as fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Central banks may use various strategies to combat inflation, like increasing interest rates, which can impact the Company's borrowing costs. Currency exchange rate fluctuations can impact the value of the U.S. Dollar against other international currencies, affecting the value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can disrupt the business of independent manufacturers producing the Company's products by increasing costs and financing difficulties for raw materials. The Company hedges certain foreign currency exposures to mitigate, but not eliminate, the effects of currency fluctuations on its financial results. Hedging activities are aimed at reducing volatility, which can lessen both negative and positive impacts of a stronger or weaker U.S. Dollar on the Company's financial results. The Company's future financial performance has been and could be significantly influenced by the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies in which it operates. The extent to which the Company's financial results are influenced by currency fluctuations depends partly on its hedging activities.", "Our financial health may be negatively impacted by the financial health of our wholesale customers. We assess our customers' financial condition before extending credit, typically not requiring collateral. We offer selected customers the option to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery through our futures ordering program. Advance orders under the futures ordering program can be canceled under certain conditions, especially with financially unstable or uncertain retailers. Some customers have faced financial difficulties, including bankruptcies in the past, impacting our sales and receivables. A weakening retail economy or shifting consumer behavior leads to retailers being more cautious with orders. Economic slowdowns or changes in key markets, like recessions, can harm the financial health of our customers, affecting our financial condition. Retailers play a crucial role in selling our products; financial troubles may lead to reduced investments in merchandising, impacting our sales. Climate change, sustainability issues, legal regulations, or market responses to them could negatively affect our business and operations.", "Increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may lead to global temperature rise, changes in weather patterns, and more extreme weather events. Climate change can worsen challenges related to water and raw material availability and quality, possibly affecting the company's production process. Climate change may prompt changes in regulations and consumer preferences, potentially impacting the company's business and financial status. Stakeholders are increasingly prioritizing sustainability in product manufacturing, leading to potential increased costs for transparency and compliance. Governmental authorities worldwide are likely to propose initiatives to address climate change, potentially increasing operational complexity and costs. Compliance with varying global climate regulations may require additional investments, impacting raw material availability, product demand, and business outcomes.", "Announced sustainability-related goals and targets may not align with stakeholders' perspectives on strategies. Perception of failure to achieve sustainability goals or address climate change regulations could harm business reputation. Execution of strategies and goal achievement are at risk due to factors beyond control. Factors affecting strategy execution include costs, timeframes, raw material availability, and technological difficulties. Adapting to regulations, customer preferences, and competition is crucial for sustainable supply chain solutions. Success in executing sustainability strategies is uncertain and could harm business reputation and relationships. Extreme weather and natural disasters may have a negative impact on operating results and financial condition.", "The company is vulnerable to physical risks of climate change due to its broad and global operations. Extreme weather conditions could adversely affect various aspects of the company's operations and financial condition. Natural disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis, floods, or droughts have the potential to disrupt the company's operations, suppliers, manufacturers, and result in economic instability. The company's success in the event of a natural disaster depends on the safety and availability of personnel and facilities, as well as the functioning of computer systems. Severe weather events or natural disasters could negatively impact retail traffic, consumer spending, and merchandise trends. Climate change may increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, affecting global business operations and third-party vendors. The company believes its diversity of locations, operational size, disaster recovery planning, and information technology systems position it well to handle disasters, but there may be gaps for all eventualities. Experiencing local or regional disasters or business continuity events could impact the company's operations.", "Local or regional events may impact human capital across operations. Local or regional events may affect key executive officers or personnel. The company's world headquarters is in an active seismic zone, increasing earthquake risks. Failure to find alternative suppliers or repair key locations may lead to delivery delays. Failure to repair IT or supply systems may result in delivery issues. Delivery problems may cause reputational damage, lost sales, and financial impact.", "Our financial condition and results of operations have been adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics, or public health emergencies. A pandemic, like the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause business slowdown or shutdown, disruption in financial markets, and adverse impacts to our global supply chain, factory cancellation costs, store closures, retail traffic decline, and discretionary spending decrease by consumers. Preventative measures during such crises may affect our business, sales, financial condition, results of operations, and drive changes in the mix of earnings across jurisdictions resulting in a volatile effective tax rate. It is uncertain how future pandemics and preventative measures will impact our sales, operations, and financial results. Risks from pandemics and public health emergencies include deterioration in economic conditions globally, disruption to distribution centers, contract manufacturers, factories, and other vendors, causing inventory production and distribution issues like inventory shortages or higher inventory levels in various markets. Supply chain effects such as labor and container shortages, increased operating costs, and extended inventory transit times can negatively impact our ability to meet consumer demand, increase costs of production and distribution, and result in higher freight, logistics costs, and other expenses.", "Retail traffic decreased due to store closures, reduced operating hours, social distancing restrictions, and changes in consumer behavior. Consumer demand for products decreased due to rise in unemployment rates, higher borrowing costs, inflation, and diminished consumer confidence. Sports event cancellations, bans on public gatherings, and reduced consumer spending may impact our products and deals with key endorsers. Risk of safety protocol ineffectiveness or perception issues in NIKE-owned facilities and potential virus-related illnesses. Incremental costs incurred for preventative measures and regulatory compliance, including providing facial coverings, hand sanitizer, and rearranging operations. Wholesale customers facing bankruptcies or financial difficulties may delay payments, revise terms, or cancel/reduce orders. Global financial market disruption and volatility may adversely affect our future capital access.", "Predicting the impact of pandemics or public health emergencies on business is challenging due to various factors such as duration, spread, governmental regulations, effectiveness of containment measures, vaccine availability and global economic conditions. Disruptions in the past have made it difficult to compare performance metrics like revenue growth and profitability across quarters and fiscal years. Pandemics or public health emergencies may have unknown or underestimated effects on business, operations, and financial condition, potentially exacerbating other risks. Failure to maintain reputation, brand image, and culture could harm the business. Success of iconic brands depends on efforts in design, marketing, advertising, consumer campaigns, product innovation, and quality. Investments in design, marketing, and sustainability efforts may not always have the desired impact on brand image and reputation. Adapting to a rapidly changing digital environment, including social media and digital advertising, is crucial for maintaining and expanding brand image. Failure to adapt to digital changes could have adverse impacts on the business.", "Brand value depends on maintaining positive consumer perception of corporate integrity, purpose, and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity could damage reputation and brand image, regardless of accuracy. Suppliers of products must comply with laws and regulations, but their practices are not directly controlled. Negative publicity about suppliers' violations could harm brand image and consumer trust.

Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters slightly exceed those in the second and third fiscal quarters. The mix of product sales can vary due to strategic shifts in the business, seasonal or geographic demand, and timing of significant sporting events. Customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules, or alter product mix with minimal notice, making accurate quarterly sales predictions difficult. Results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly due to these factors and others beyond the company's control, such as economic conditions, consumer preferences, weather, disease outbreaks, and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Operating margins are sensitive to factors like manufacturing and transportation costs, product sales mix, and geographic sales trends. Results in any period may not reflect future performance.

Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase the company's credit risk. Consolidation of retailers may impair the company's ability to sell products. Some countries' athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retail markets are dominated by a few large retailers. Market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions, construction of additional stores, and investments in digital capacity. Struggling retailers exiting the market may lead to market share concentration among a few retailers. Consolidation of the company's retailers will concentrate its credit risk with a smaller set of retailers. If any retailer substantially reduces purchases of the company's products, the company may struggle to find sufficient retail outlets for its products. If one or more counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations or fail, the company may incur significant losses.", "The company engages in hedging activities using derivative financial instruments like forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars, and swaps with various financial institutions.

Foreign exchange fluctuations could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of investments and the value of future repatriated earnings. The company has hedged and may hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations. Hedges on net investment positions are accounted for as net investment hedges according to U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2023 and 2022. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

Unfavorable changes in Accounts payable offset favorable impacts from Inventories and Accounts receivable in fiscal 2023. Reduced inventory purchases and timing of wholesale shipments affected the net change in working capital for fiscal 2023. Lower available supply of inventory in the prior year was due to supply chain constraints.", "Cash provided by investing activities was $564 million in fiscal 2023, compared to an outflow of $1,524 million in fiscal 2022, mainly due to changes in short-term investments. For fiscal 2023, the net change in short-term investments led to a cash inflow of $1,481 million, whereas it resulted in a cash outflow of $747 million in fiscal 2022. Investments were made in infrastructure to support future growth, particularly in digital capabilities, technology foundation, corporate facilities, and improvements in the supply chain. Cash used in financing activities was $7,447 million in fiscal 2023, higher than the $4,836 million in fiscal 2022, driven by increased share repurchases, repayment of senior notes, and lower proceeds from stock option exercises. Share repurchases in fiscal 2023 amounted to $5,480 million, exceeding the $4,014 million in fiscal 2022. Repayment of $500 million of senior notes that matured in fiscal 2023 contributed to the increased outflow in financing activities.

Changes in long-term debt ratings would not accelerate maturity of outstanding or future borrowings under committed credit facilities. The company is bound by covenants under the committed credit facilities, including limits on asset disposal and secured debt incurring. Failure to meet covenants without obtaining a waiver would result in immediate repayment of outstanding borrowings.

Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and require estimates and judgments affecting reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note 1. Assumptions and judgments in accounting estimates have the greatest potential impact on the Financial Statements, considered critical. Management reviewed critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Actual results could differ from estimates in the Financial Statements due to inherent uncertainty. No reasonably likely events or circumstances are currently identified that would materially change reported amounts. Provisions for anticipated sales returns include contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts include contractual programs and discretionary discounts expected to be granted later.", "Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts, and claims are based on historical rates. Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts, and claims are based on specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers, outstanding discounts, and claims. Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts, and claims are based on estimated returns, discounts, and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts, and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. Significantly different actual or expected future returns, discounts, or claims than reserves established would result in a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which such determination was made. Refer to Note 14 \u2014 Revenues in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If the estimated net realizable value of inventory is less than the cost recorded on our books, a reserve equal to the difference is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. Changes in market conditions resulting in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of inventory below the previous estimate would lead to an increase in the reserve in the period of determination. The hedge accounting for derivatives is not further detailed in this section.", "The company uses derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency and interest rate transactions, as well as certain monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of contracts hedging future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income until they impact Net income. Usually, gains and losses on hedge derivatives are moved from Accumulated other comprehensive income to Net income after the derivative matures. One criterion for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of derivative contracts should not exceed the designated amount of anticipated transactions. If anticipated or actual transactions decrease below hedged levels, or if forecasted transactions become unlikely, the fair value change of over-hedged contracts is moved to Other (income) expense, net. In rare cases, extenuating circumstances may cause a forecasted transaction to be delayed beyond the typical two-month period.", "The company is subject to taxation in the United States, various state, and foreign jurisdictions. Determining the provision for income taxes involves significant judgment, use of estimates, and interpretation of complex tax laws. The company estimates its effective tax rate for the full fiscal year on an interim basis. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to year-to-date Income before income taxes, excluding infrequent or unusual items, to calculate year-to-date Income tax expense. Income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the period they occur. The company refines its tax rate estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction throughout the fiscal year. Changes in the estimated effective tax rate prompt adjustments to the income tax provision during the quarter of the change. On a quarterly basis, the company assesses the probability of effectively sustaining a tax position and the appropriateness of recognized amounts for uncertain tax positions. Changes in assessment may result in recognizing a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in Income tax expense. Refer to Note 7 \u2014 Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on income taxes.", "The company is involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations related to its business, products, and actions of employees and representatives. Contingent liabilities are recorded when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses involves analyzing multiple factors, including judgments about potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best available information, but actual losses in the future are uncertain. Any future adjustments to estimated probable losses exceeding recorded liability would result in additional charges. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will significantly exceed the recorded liability. The company uses financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates. Financial instruments are only used to finance the business and manage exposures, not for trading or speculative purposes.", "The company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations due to international sales, product sourcing, and funding activities. The foreign exchange risk management program aims to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on the company's financial results. The company uses forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions and firm commitments, delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on financial statements. Hedging decisions, instruments, and timing are guided by company policies and market conditions. Derivatives outstanding are mainly for foreign currency cash flow hedges in Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Earnings are exposed to short- and long-term market interest rate movements. The company manages interest rate exposure to limit earnings and cash flow impact and reduce borrowing costs. Market risk, including foreign exchange and interest rate risks, is monitored through techniques such as sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Market-sensitive financial instruments include foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany loans in non-functional currencies, and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.", "VaR is used to monitor foreign exchange risk of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in VaR computation. Computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates using a 'variance/co-variance' technique. Interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the previous one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. Potential loss in option value is adjusted for estimated sensitivity ('delta' and 'gamma') to changes in the underlying currency rate. Calculation reflects impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on derivative instruments only, excluding non-functional currency transactions. VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not represent actual losses incurred or consider potential favorable changes in market rates. VaR model does not show the full extent of possible losses and actual future gains and losses will differ due to various factors.", "The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments using the VaR model was $111 million as of May 31, 2023. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments using the VaR model was $99 million as of May 31, 2022. The VaR increased year-over-year due to an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2023. A hypothetical loss in the fair value of derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $289 million during fiscal 2023. The average monthly change in fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $170 million during fiscal 2022. Intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt are not included in the VaR. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through forward contracts included in the VaR calculation.

Short-term investments are liquid investments with maturities over three months, consisting of available-for-sale debt securities recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), unless they are deemed unrecoverable. Realized gains and losses are determined by specific identification. The company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those maturing beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs.

Development costs of computer software for sale or lease are capitalized from technological feasibility to general release, with most costs expensed as incurred once feasibility is established.", "The Company reviews long-lived assets for potential impairment if events suggest the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that trigger an impairment assessment include adverse changes in asset usage, legal factors, business climate, or market value. If potential impairment is indicated, the Company assesses recoverability by comparing the carrying value to projected undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying value is deemed unrecoverable, the Company estimates the fair value of the asset group using valuation methodologies like discounted cash flows. Impairment is calculated as the variance between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset group. The Company conducts annual impairment tests on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, usually in the fourth quarter or when events suggest a potential reduction in fair value. Goodwill is allocated across reporting units, which represent the Company's operating segments, for impairment testing. Qualitative factors are assessed to determine if it's likely that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is lower than its carrying amount. If it's determined that fair value exceeds carrying amount, no impairment test is required for the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset.", "If an impairment test is required, the Company will estimate the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is higher than its fair value, the Company will record an impairment charge equal to the excess. The goodwill of the impaired reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset will be determined to be impaired. As of May 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no accumulated impairment losses. The impact on Goodwill from acquisitions and divestitures during fiscal 2023 and 2022 was not significant. The Company leases retail store space, distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment, and other non-real estate assets primarily. Lease activity is recorded at the commencement date, usually when the Company takes possession or controls the physical use of the asset. Lease components are not separated from non-lease components for real estate leases in the Company's portfolio. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable.", "Lease agreements may include rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays, and landlord incentives like tenant improvement allowances. ROU assets consist of scheduled rent increases and are reduced by lease incentives. The lease term covers the non-cancelable period and options to extend or terminate when the Company is likely to exercise them. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; related lease payments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis. Some lease agreements involve variable lease payments based on retail sales percentages or inflation adjustments tied to indices like the Consumer Price Index; these payments are expensed as incurred. The Company values certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value regularly, such as derivatives, equity securities, and available-for-sale debt securities. Fair value reflects the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The fair value measurement hierarchy used by the Company has three levels based on the types of inputs: Level 1 includes quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 comprises observable inputs other than quoted prices, and Level 3 involves unobservable inputs. Judgment is utilized in assessing the significance of inputs to fair value measurement, with financial assets and liabilities classified based on the most conservative significant input level. The Company's evaluation of fair value measurements considers asset-specific or liability-specific factors.", "Pricing vendors are used for Level 1 and Level 2 investments. Vendors provide market prices in an active market or use observable inputs without significant adjustments. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, and credit risks. Derivative contract fair value is determined using observable market inputs like foreign currency rates, pricing curves, volatilities, correlations, and interest rates. The fair value process involves comparing values to an independent pricing vendor. Refer to Note 4 - Fair Value Measurements for more details.

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), Long-term debt, or Net income depending on the underlying exposure, hedge designation, and hedge effectiveness. Cash flows at settlement from derivatives are classified in the same category as cash flows from related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, cash flows are primarily within the Cash provided by operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, cash flows are within the Cash provided by investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Stock options provided by the Company expire 10 years from the grant date, while most awards vest ratably over four years of continuous employment. Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the Company's performance criteria over a three-year period and continued employment. The fair value of options, stock appreciation rights, and ESPPs is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock and time-vesting restricted stock units is based on the market price on the grant date. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. Refer to Note 9 - Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation in the 2023 FORM 10-K for more information on the Company's stock-based compensation programs.", "The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded by the Company to reduce deferred tax assets to a more likely than not realized amount. Realization of deferred tax assets depends on future taxable earnings and is uncertain. The Company assesses taxable income, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income, and tax planning strategies at least quarterly. Forecasts of taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization are considered by the Company in assessing realization of deferred tax assets, which can vary significantly from estimated results. If the Company does not believe recovery is likely, a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset, increasing income tax expense. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in financial statements if it's more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in Income tax expense by the Company. Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. Management estimates are discussed further in Note 7 \u2014 Income Taxes and Note 10 \u2014 Earnings Per Share.", "Financial statements require management to make estimates regarding assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, which could differ from actual results.

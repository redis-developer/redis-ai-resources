# Recipes

Need specific sample code to help get started with Redis? Start here.

## Getting started with Redis & Vector Search

| Recipe | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [/redis-intro/redis_intro.ipynb](python-recipes/redis-intro/redis_intro.ipynb) | The place to start if brand new to Redis |
| [/vector-search/00_redispy.ipynb](python-recipes/vector-search/00_redispy.ipynb) | Vector search with Redis python client |
| [/vector-search/01_redisvl.ipynb](python-recipes/vector-search/01_redisvl.ipynb) | Vector search with Redis Vector Library |

## Getting started with RAG

**Retrieval Augmented Generation** (aka RAG) is a technique to enhance the ability of an LLM to respond to user queries. The **retrieval** part of RAG is supported by a vector database, which can return semantically relevant results to a user’s query, serving as contextual information to **augment** the **generative** capabilities of an LLM.

To get started with RAG, either from scratch or using a popular framework like Llamaindex or LangChain, go with these recipes:

| Recipe | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [/RAG/01_redisvl.ipynb](python-recipes/RAG/01_redisvl.ipynb) | RAG from scratch with the Redis Vector Library |
| [/RAG/02_langchain.ipynb](python-recipes/RAG/02_langchain.ipynb) | RAG using Redis and LangChain |
| [/RAG/03_llamaindex.ipynb](python-recipes/RAG/03_llamaindex.ipynb) | RAG using Redis and LlamaIndex |
| [/RAG/04_advanced_redisvl.ipynb](python-recipes/RAG/04_advanced_redisvl.ipynb) | Advanced RAG with redisvl |
| [/RAG/05_nvidia_ai_rag_redis.ipynb](python-recipes/RAG/05_nvidia_ai_rag_redis.ipynb) | RAG using Redis and Nvidia |


## Semantic Cache
An estimated 31% of LLM queries are potentially redundant ([source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02694)). Redis enables semantic caching to help cut down on LLM costs quickly.

| Recipe | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [/semantic-cache/semantic_caching_gemini.ipynb](python-recipes/semantic-cache/semantic_caching_gemini.ipynb) | Build a semantic cache with Redis and Google Gemini |

## Advanced RAG
For further insights on enhancing RAG applications with dense content representations, query re-writing, and other techniques.

| Recipe | Description |
| --- | --- |
[/RAG/04_advanced_redisvl.ipynb](python-recipes/RAG/04_advanced_redisvl.ipynb) | Notebook for additional tips and techniques to improve RAG quality |

## Recommendation systems

An exciting example of how Redis can power production-ready systems is highlighted in our collaboration with [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/offline-to-online-feature-storage-for-real-time-recommendation-systems-with-nvidia-merlin/) to construct a state-of-the-art recommendation system.

Within [this repository](https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-nvidia-recsys), you'll find three examples, each escalating in complexity, showcasing the process of building such a system.

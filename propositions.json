Despite global economic uncertainty, the company experienced revenue growth in fiscal 2023 due to strong demand for its products. Ongoing monitoring of macroeconomic conditions will include assessing the impact of inflation and rising interest rates on consumer behavior. Inflationary pressures in fiscal 2023, such as higher input and logistics costs, negatively affected gross margins. Strategic pricing actions helped partially mitigate these challenges. Supply chain disruptions, macroeconomic conditions, and COVID-19 impacts led to elevated inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

The shift to a distributor model within the Central and South America (CASA) territory is expected to reduce consolidated Nike, Inc. and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA) revenue growth due to different commercial terms. Over time, the new operating model is expected to positively impact overall profitability by reducing selling and administrative expenses and exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility.

Unfavorable changes in Accounts payable, offset by favorable impacts from Inventories and Accounts receivable, affected the net change in working capital for fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year. Reduced inventory purchases and timing of wholesale shipments impacted the net change in working capital for fiscal 2023. Lower available supply of inventory in the prior year due to supply chain constraints impacted the changes in working capital.", "Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2023 was $564 million, an inflow, compared to an outflow of $1,524 million in fiscal 2022, driven by the net change in short-term investments.

Cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2023 was $7,447 million, an outflow, compared to $4,836 million in fiscal 2022. The increased outflow in fiscal 2023 was due to higher share repurchases of $5,480 million, repayment of $500 million of senior notes, and lower proceeds from stock option exercises. In fiscal 2023, 50.0 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock were purchased for $5.5 billion, at an average price of $110.32 per share. A previous four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program was terminated in August 2022, after repurchasing 6.5 million shares for $710.0 million and 83.8 million shares for $9.4 billion.

The fair value of such indemnification is considered immaterial based on historical experience and estimated future loss probability.", "Note 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of significant accounting policies, including recently adopted and issued accounting standards. Financial statements are prepared according to U.S. GAAP and involve making estimates and judgments that impact reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates, discussed with the Audit & Finance Committee, are assumptions and judgments with the greatest potential impact on the financial statements. Actual results may differ from estimates used in the financial statements due to inherent uncertainty. There are no known events or circumstances that would likely result in materially different reported amounts. Sales-related reserves include provisions for anticipated sales returns and post-invoice sales discounts, which consist of contractual and discretionary components.", "Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts, and claims are based on historical rates. Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts, and claims are based on specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims. Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts, and claims are based on estimated returns, discounts, and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts, and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from recorded estimates. Significantly different actual or expected future returns, discounts, or claims from reserves established would result in a reduction or increase to net revenues. A reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period when determining significant differences in actual or expected future returns, discounts, or claims. Inventory reserves are estimated based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If the estimated net realizable value of inventory is less than the recorded cost, a reserve equal to the difference is recorded. Changes in market conditions leading to reductions in estimated net realizable value result in an increase in the reserve. Hedge accounting is applied for derivatives.", "The company uses derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency and interest rate transactions, as well as non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. Gains and losses on hedge derivatives are released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income after the maturity of the derivative. The notional value of derivative contracts should not exceed the designated amount of anticipated transactions to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. If anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if a forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion is reclassified to Other (income) expense, net. Reclassification occurs when a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur within the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period thereafter. In some cases, the additional period of time for reclassification may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances beyond the company's control. Additional information about risk management and derivatives can be found in Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The details about income taxes are likely discussed further in the document.", "The company is subject to taxation in the United States, various state and foreign jurisdictions. Determining the provision for income taxes involves significant judgment, use of estimates, interpretation of complex tax laws. The company estimates its effective tax rate for the full fiscal year on an interim basis. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to year-to-date income before income taxes (excluding unusual items) to calculate year-to-date income tax expense. Income tax effects of unusual items are recognized in the interim period they occur. The company continually refines its tax estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction throughout the fiscal year. Changes in the estimated effective tax rate lead to adjustments in the income tax provision during the quarter of the estimate change. On a quarterly basis, the company assesses the probability of effectively sustaining a tax position and the appropriateness of recognized amounts for uncertain tax positions. Changes in assessment may result in recognition of a tax benefit or additional charge to the tax provision when assessments change. Interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in income tax expense. For additional information on income taxes, refer to Note 7\u2014Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "The company is involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations related to different aspects like products, employees, contracts, tax, and intellectual property. Contingent liabilities are recorded when the company is likely to incur a loss, based on the best available information. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses involves analyzing multiple factors and making judgments about potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses may result in additional charges if they exceed the recorded liability. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will significantly exceed the recorded liability. The company uses financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, following established policies and procedures. Financial instruments are used for business financing and exposure management, not for trading or speculative purposes.", "The company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations due to international sales, product sourcing, and funding activities. The foreign exchange risk management program aims to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on consolidated financial results. Forward and option contracts are utilized to hedge anticipated transactions and firm commitments, delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on financial statements. Hedging decisions, instruments, and timing are guided by company policies and market conditions. The majority of derivatives outstanding are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges for various currency pairs. Earnings are also exposed to fluctuations in short- and long-term market interest rates. Managing interest rate exposure involves maintaining a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt. Market risk, including foreign exchange and interest rate risk, is monitored using techniques such as sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Market-sensitive financial instruments include foreign currency contracts, intercompany loans in non-functional currencies, and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar debt.", "VaR is used to monitor foreign exchange risk for foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments. VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model assumes normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in VaR computation. Computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates using a 'variance/co-variance' technique. Interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options is adjusted for estimated sensitivity ('delta' and 'gamma') to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on derivative instruments only. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not predict actual losses in fair value incurred. It also does not consider the potential effect of favorable market rate changes or the full extent of possible losses. Actual future gains and losses will differ from estimates due to changes in market rates, hedging instruments, timing, and other factors.", "The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments using the VaR model was $111 million as of May 31, 2023. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments using the VaR model was $99 million as of May 31, 2022. The VaR increased year-over-year due to higher foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2023. A hypothetical loss in the fair value of derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $289 million during fiscal 2023. The average monthly change in fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $170 million during fiscal 2022. Intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt are not included in the VaR. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through forward contracts, included in the VaR calculation. Interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with non-functional currency intercompany loans are considered immaterial to consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Details of third-party debt including principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates are provided in a table.

Forecasts of taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization are used by the Company to assess realization of deferred tax assets, leading to potential significant variation in estimated and actual results. A valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset if recovery is deemed unlikely, increasing the Company's income tax expense. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. Interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in the Income tax expense.
